<p>By means of these scattered chapters the
writer has come to know women better—their
traditions, desires, and delights. If through
these pages women should know themselves
and what they may become in regard and
temper for their lovers, friends, children, and
their own sakes, it will well reward the pleasant
labor which has already met such kind
appreciation. Begun by chance, to make an
agreeable article or two for <i>Harper’s Bazar</i>,
the “Ugly-Girl Papers” were continued by
request, and have brought the writer into
friendly bearings with many of the readers
of the <i>Bazar</i>. To their questions and hints
these chapters owe more of their value than
appears on the surface; and the little book
goes out hoping to meet, if not new friends,
at least some old ones.</p>

<p>The science of the toilet is well-nigh as
delicate as that of medicine; and as no prescription
has yet proved a specific for disease,
no recipe can reach all cases of complexion.
I could wish for this book the good-will and
consideration of physicians, under whose advice
it may be hoped its suggestions will approve
themselves of wide service.</p>

<p>The first requisite in a woman toward pleasing
others is that she should be pleased with
herself. In no other way can she attain that
self-poise, that satisfaction, which leaves her
at liberty to devote herself successfully to
others.</p>

<p>I appeal to the ugly sisterhood to know if
this is not so. Could a woman be made to
believe herself beautiful, it would go far toward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>making her so. Those hopeless, shrinking
souls, alive with devotion and imagination,
with hearts as fit to make passionate and worshiped
lovers, or steadfast and inspiring heroines,
as the fairest Venus of the sex, need not
for an instant believe there is no alleviation
for their case, no chance of making face and
figure more attractive and truer exponents of
the spirit within.</p>

<p>There is scarcely any thing in the history
of women more touching than the homage
paid to beauty by those who have it not. No
slave among her throng of adorers appreciated
more keenly the beauty of Récamier than the
skeleton-like, irritable Madame De Chateaubriand.
The loveliness of a rival eats into a
girl’s heart like corrosion; every fair curling
hair, every grace of outline, is traced in lines
of fire on the mind of the plainer one, and reproduced
with microscopic fidelity. It is a
woman’s business to be beautiful. She recommends
every virtue and heroism by the
grace which sets them forth. Women of genius
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>are the first to lay the crown of womanhood
on the head of the most beautiful.
Mere fashion of face and form are not
meant by beauty, but that symmetry and
brightness which come of physical and spiritual
refinement. Such are the heroines of
Scott, Disraeli, and Bulwer, as inspiring as
they are rare. Toward such ideals all women
yearn.</p>

<p>Who will say that this most natural feeling
of the feminine heart may not have some fulfillment
in the first thirty years of life? This
limit is given because the latest authorities in
social science assert that woman’s prime of
youth is twenty-six, moving the barriers a
good ten years ahead from the old standard
of the novelist, whose heroines are always in
the dew of sixteen. In the very first place,
one may boldly say that beauty, or rather fascination,
is not a matter of youth, and no
woman ought to sigh over her years till she
feels the frost creeping into her heart. Men
of the world understand well that a woman’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>wit is finest, and her heart yields the richest
wealth, when experience has formed the fair
and colorless material of youth. A sweet girl
of seventeen and a high-bred beauty of thirty,
if well preserved, may dispute the palm. I
do not mean to decry rose-buds and dew.
One hardly knows which to love them for
most—their loveliness or their briefness. But
women who look their thirties in the face
should not lay down the sceptre of life, or
fancy that its delights for them are over.
They are young while they seem young.</p>

<p>Then we may boldly set about renovating
the outward form, sure that Nature will respond
to our efforts. The essence of beauty
is health; but all apparently healthy people
are not fair. The type of the system must be
considered in treatment. The brunette is usually
built up of much iron, and the bilious
secretion is sluggish. The blonde is apt to
be dyspeptic, and subject to disturbances of
the blood. From these causes result freckles,
pimples, and that coarse, indented skin <i>stippled</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>with punctures, like the tissue of pig-skin—a
fault of many otherwise clear complexions.</p>

<p>The fairest skins belong to people in the
earliest stage of consumption, or those of a
scrofulous nature. This miraculous clearness
and brilliance is due to the constant purgation
which wastes the consumptive, or to the issue
which relieves the system of impurities by one
outlet. We must secure purity of the blood
by less exhaustive methods. The diet should
be regulated according to the habit of the
person. If stout, she should eat as little as
will satisfy her appetite; never allowing herself,
however, to rise from the table hungry.
A few days’ resolute denial will show how
much really is needed to keep up the strength.
When recovering from severe nervous prostration,
years ago, the writer found her appetite
gone. The least morsel satisfied hunger, and
more produced a repugnance she never tried
to overcome. She resumed study six hours a
day and walked two miles every day from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>suburbs to the centre of the city, and back
again. Breakfast usually was a small saucer
of strawberries and one Graham cracker, and
was not infrequently dispensed with altogether.
Lunch was half an orange—for the burden of
eating the other half was not to be thought
of; and at six o’clock a handful of cherries
formed a plentiful dinner. Once a week she
did crave something like beef-steak or soup,
and took it. But, guiding herself wholly by
appetite, she found with surprise that her
strength remained steady, her nerves grew
calm, and her ability to study was never better.
This is no rule for any one, farther than
to say persons of well-developed physique
need not fear any limitation of diet for a
time which does not tell on the strength and
is approved by appetite. Never eat too much;
never go hungry.</p>

<p>For weak digestion nothing is so relished or
strengthens so much as the rich beef tea, or
rather gravy, prepared from the beef-jelly sold
by first-rate grocers. This is very different
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>from the extracts of beef made by chemists.
The condensed beef prepared by the same
companies which send out the condensed
milk is preferable, in all respects, as to taste
and nourishment. A table-spoonful of this
jelly, dissolved by pouring a cup of boiling
water on it, and drank when cool, will give as
much strength as three fourths of a pound of
beef-steak broiled. For singers and students,
who need a light but strengthening diet, nothing
is so admirable.</p>

<p>Nervous people, and sanguine ones, should
adopt a diet of eggs, fish, soups, and salads,
with fruit. This cools the blood, and leaves
the strength to supply the nerves instead of
taxing them to digest heavy preparations.
Lymphatic people should especially prefer
such lively salads as cress, pepper-grass, horseradish,
and mustard. These are nature’s correctives,
and should appear on the table from
March to November, to be eaten not merely
as relishes, but as stimulating and beneficial
food. They stir the blood, and clear the eye
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>and brain from the humors of spring. Nervous
people should be more sparing of these
fiery delights, and eat abundantly of golden
lettuce, which contains opium in its most delicate
and least injurious state. The question
of fat meat does not seem satisfactorily settled.
I should compound by using rich soups
which contain the essence of meats, and supply
carbon by salad-oil and a free use of nuts
or cream. Plump, fair people may let oily
matters of all kinds carefully alone. Thin
ones should eat vegetables—if they can find a
cook who knows how to make them palatable.
It is strange that in this country, which produces
the finest vegetables, fit for the envy of
foreign cooks, not one out of a hundred knows
how to prepare them properly. People who
are anxious to be rid of flesh should choose
acids, lemons, limes, and tamarinds, eat sparingly
of dry meats, with crackers instead of
bread, and follow strictly the advice now
given.</p>

<p>To clear the complexion or reduce the size,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>the blood must be carefully cleansed. Two
simple chemicals should appear on every toilet-table—the
carbonate of ammonia and powdered
charcoal. No cosmetic has more frequent
uses than these. The ammonia must
be kept in glass, with a glass stopper, from
the air. French charcoal is preferred by physicians,
as it is more finely ground, and a large
bottle of it should be kept on hand. In cases
of debility and all wasting disorders it is valuable.
To clear the complexion, take a teaspoonful
of charcoal well mixed in water or
honey for three nights, then use a simple purgative
to remove it from the system. It acts
like calomel, with no bad effects, purifying the
blood more effectually than any thing else.
But some simple aperient must not be omitted,
or the charcoal will remain in the system,
a mass of festering poison, with all the impurities
it absorbs. After this course of purification,
tonics may be used. Many people seem
not to know that protoxide of iron, medicated
wine, and “bracing” medicines are useless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>when the impurities remain in the blood.
The use of charcoal is daily better understood
by our best physicians, and it is powerful, and
simple enough to be handled by every household.
The purifying process, unless the health
is unusually good, must be repeated every
three months. We absorb in bad food and
air more unprofitable matter than nature can
throw off in that time. If diet and atmosphere
were perfect, no such aid would be
needed; but it is the choice between a very
great and a small evil in existing conditions.
A free use of tomatoes and figs is, by the way,
recommended, to maintain a healthy condition
of the stomach, and the seeds of either should
<i>not</i> be discarded.</p>

<p>The most troublesome task is to refine a
<i>stippled</i> skin whose oil-glands are large and
coarse. There may not be a pimple or freckle
on the face, and the temples may be smooth,
but the nose and cheeks look like a pin-cushion
from which the pins have just been
drawn. Patience and many applications are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>necessary, for one must, in fact, renew the
skin.</p>

<p>The worst face may be softened by wearing
a mask of quilted cotton wet in cold water
at night. Roman ladies used poultices of
bread and asses’ milk for the same purpose;
but water, and especially distilled water, is all
that is needful. A small dose of taraxacum
every other night will assist in refining the
skin. But it will be at least a six weeks’
work to effect the desired change; and it will
be a zealous girl who submits to the discomfort
of the mask for that length of time. The
result pays. The compress acts like a mild
but imperceptible blister, and leaves a new
skin, soft as an infant’s. Bathing oily skins
with camphor dries the oil somewhat, when the
camphor would parch nice complexions. The
opium found in the stalks of flowering lettuce
refines the skin singularly, and may be used
clear, instead of the soap which sells so high.
Rub the milky juice collected from broken
stems of coarse garden lettuce over the face
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>at night, and wash with a solution of ammonia
in the morning.</p>

<p>Blondes who are unbeautiful are apt to
have divers irritations of the skin, which their
darker neighbors do not know. People of
this type also have a tendency to acid stomachs,
the antidote for which is a dose of ammonia,
say one quarter of a spoonful in half a
glass of water, taken every night and morning.
This also prevents decay of the teeth and
sweetens the breath, and is less injurious than
the soda and magnesia many ladies use for
acid stomachs. In summer the system should
be kept cool by bathing at night and morning,
and by tart drinks containing cream of tartar.
Small quantities of nitre, prescribed by the
physician, may be taken by very sanguine persons
who suffer with heat; but pale complexions
should seek the sun when its power is not
too great, and be careful, of all things, to avoid
a chill. This deadens the skin, paints blue circles
round the eyes, and leaves the hands an
uncertain color.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>
<p>These precautions may seem burdensome,
but they all have been practiced by those who
prize beauty. Nothing is so attractive, so suggestive
of purity of mind and excellence of
body, as a clear, fine-grained skin. Strong
color is not desirable. Tints, rather than colors,
best please the refined eye in the complexion.
Some mothers are so anxious to secure
this grace for their daughters that they
are kept on the strictest diet from childhood.
The most dazzling Parian could not be more
beautiful than the cheek of a child I once
saw who was kept on oatmeal porridge for
this effect. At a boarding-school, I remember,
a fashionable mother gave strict injunctions
that her daughter should touch nothing but
brown bread and syrup. This was hard fare;
but the carmine lips and magnolia brow of
the young lady were the envy of her schoolmates,
who, however, were not courageous
enough to attempt such a régime for themselves.</p>

<p>St. Paul approved himself no less a connoisseur
of female beauty than a censor of decorum
when he wrote, “If a woman have long
hair, it is a glory to her.” This is in no wise
inconsistent with the other apostolic passage
which discourages ornate hair-dressing, for
abundant shining hair needs less care to arrange
than a scanty crop that must be disposed
to the best advantage. The woman
whose magnificent chevelure reaches to her
waist, thick as one’s wrist when tightly bound,
needs no braid nor cataract, finger-puff nor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>snow-curl, nor band of gold or amber to crown
herself. Every girl ought to have such hair.
Mothers should remember that such gifts of
nature form a dowry which has no little
weight in the incidents of a woman’s life, and
should cultivate assiduously the locks of their
daughters. It is not best to keep them closely
cut: after five years they should never be
touched by scissors, save to clip the ends once
a month, as hereafter explained, but should be
smoothly braided in long Marguerite plaits,
the most convenient style, unless the mother
is ambitious of seeing her pet’s hair in curls.
Hardly any locks will resist good discipline,
if taken in the downy stage of infancy and
submitted to papillotes. It is a mistaken notion
that a luxuriant growth of hair in childhood
weakens the head. Nature is not in the
habit of providing superfluities. The Breton
women are noted for their magnificent hair,
which is allowed to grow from childhood.
The barbarity of the fine comb should be
abolished in civilized nurseries, and a daily or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>semi-weekly wash with ammonia or soap substituted,
with a thorough brushing afterward.
A child’s head is too tender for any rasping
process; even knotted snarls should be cut
rather than pulled out. Send tow-headed children
into the sun as much as possible, that its
rays may affect every particle of the iron in
the blood, and change the flaxen colors to
more agreeable shades.</p>

<p>When the hair has been neglected, cut it to an
even length, and wash the scalp nightly with soft
water into which ammonia has been poured.
This may be as strong as possible at first, so
that it does not burn the skin. Afterward
the proportions may be three large spoonfuls
of ammonia to a basin of water. Apply with
a brush, stirring the hair well while the head
is partially immersed. Do this at night, so
that it may have a chance to dry, for nothing
is so disagreeable as hair put up wet and
turned musty. Wring and wipe it thoroughly,
then comb and shake out the tresses in a
draft of air till nearly dry, when it may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>done up in a cotton net. Night-caps heat the
head and injure hair. Ammonia is the most
healthful and efficient stimulus known for the
hair, and quickens its growth when nothing
else will do so. A healthy system will supply
oil enough for the hair if the head is kept
clean. If the scalp is unnaturally dry, a mixture
of half an ounce of carbonate of ammonia
in a pint of sweet-oil makes the most
esteemed hair invigorator. Glycerine and ammonia
make a delicate dressing for the hair,
and will not soil the nicest bonnet. Pomades
of all kinds are voted vulgar, and justly. The
only excuse for their use is just before entering
a sea bath, when a thorough oiling of the
hair prevents injury from salt water. It
should be speedily washed off with a dilution
of ammonia.</p>

<p>When a growth of young hair is established,
it ought to lengthen at least eight inches a
year in a vigorous subject. Hair is an index
of vitality. The women of the tropics, with
their abounding health, have luxuriant chevelures.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>Among Spanish and South American
women hair a yard long, in a coil as thick as
the wrist, is the rule, and not the exception.
The warmth of those latitudes favors the secretions,
and stimulates every organ to its fullest
development. To obtain like results, we
must try to obtain the same conditions of luxuriant
health. A good circulation is essential
to fineness and pleasing color of the hair.
The scalp must be stimulated by frequent
brushing, as well as by the ammonia bath.
A lady of fashion decreed one hundred strokes
of the brush to be given her celebrated locks
daily, and those who have tried the experiment
find that it is not at all too much. Given
quickly, this number occupies three minutes
in bestowing, and surely this is little
enough time to give a fine head of hair. Once
a month the ends of the hair should be cut, to
remove the forked ends, which stop its growth.
The patrons of a certain New York school of
high repute will remember the young daughter
of an Albany gentleman, whose wonderful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>hair was the pride of the establishment. The
child was about ten years old, and her heavy
tresses reached literally to the floor. She was
not unfrequently shown to visitors as a phenomenon,
veiled in this flood of hair. On inquiry,
it was found that no peculiar treatment
was given it beyond cutting the ends regularly
every month for years.</p>

<p>An old authority gives the following as the
German method of treating the hair. The
women of that country are known to have remarkably
luxuriant locks: Once in two weeks
wash the head with a quart of soft water in
which a handful of bran has been boiled and
a little white soap dissolved. Next rub the
yolk of an egg slightly beaten into the roots of
the hair; let it remain a few minutes, and
wash it off thoroughly with pure water, rinsing
the head well. Wipe and rub the hair dry
with a towel, and comb it up from the head,
parting it with the fingers. In winter do all
this near the fire. Have ready some soft pomatum
of beef marrow, boiled with a little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>almond or olive-oil, flavored with mild perfume.
Rub a small quantity of this on the
skin of the head after it has been washed as
above. This may be efficient, but in this age
women prefer the cleanlier method of stimulating
the hair without pomade.</p>

<p>If any ladies are as fond of stirring up cosmetics
and washes as were the wife and daughters
of the Vicar of Wakefield, they may try
these highly recommended recipes:</p>

<p>The following is said to be an excellent curling
fluid: Put two pounds of common soap
cut small into three pints of spirits of wine,
and melt together, stirring with a clean piece
of wood; add essence of ambergris, citron, and
neroli, about a quarter of an ounce of each.</p>

<p>Rowland’s Macassar Oil for the hair: Take
a quarter of an ounce of the clippings of alkanet
root, tie this in a bit of coarse muslin, and
suspend it in a jar containing eight ounces of
sweet-oil for a week, covering from the dust.
Add to this sixty drops of the tincture of cantharides,
ten drops of oil of rose, neroli and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>lemon each sixty drops. Let these stand three
weeks closely corked, and you will have one
of the most powerful stimulants for the growth
of the hair ever known.</p>

<p>Take a pound and a half of southernwood
and boil it, slightly bruised, in a quart of old
olive-oil, with half a pint of port-wine or spirit.
When thoroughly boiled, strain the oil
carefully through a linen cloth. Repeat the
operation three times with fresh southernwood,
and add two ounces of bear’s grease or fresh
lard. Apply twice a week to the hair, and
brush it in well.</p>

<p>Where a hair-dye is deemed essential, the
deplorable want may be met by this recipe,
which has the merit of being less harmful
than most of the nostrums in use: Boil equal
parts of vinegar, lemon juice, and powdered
litharge for half an hour, over a slow fire, in a
porcelain-lined vessel. Wet the hair with this
decoction, and in a short time it will turn
black.</p>

<p>Lola Montez gives a hair-dye which is said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>to be instantaneous, and as harmless as any
mineral dye used. It is made from gallic
acid, ten grains; acetic acid, one ounce; tincture
of sesquichloride of iron, one ounce. Dissolve
the gallic acid in the sesquichloride, and
add the acetic acid. Wash the hair with soap
and water, and apply the dye by dipping a
fine comb in it and drawing through the hair
so as to color the roots thoroughly. Let it
dry; oil and brush.</p>

<p>White lashes and eyebrows are so disagreeably
suggestive that one can not blame their
possessor for disguising them by a harmless
device. A decoction of walnut-juice should
be made in the season, and kept in a bottle for
use the year round. It is to be applied with
a small hair-pencil to the brows and lashes,
turning them to a rich brown, which harmonizes
with fair hair. It may be applied to the
edge of the hair about the face and neck, when
that is paler than the rest. Let me repeat
that the best remedy for ill-used tresses is
strict care; glossy, vitalized tresses, kept in order
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>by constant brushing, assume by degrees
a better color. It is a mistake to soak red
hair with oil in the hope of making it darker;
it should be kept wavy and light as possible,
to show off the rich lights and shadows with
which it abounds. The sun has a good effect
on obnoxious shades of hair if it is otherwise
well attended to, and red or white locks should
be worn in floating masses, waved by fine plaiting
at night, or by crimping-pins, which <i>do not</i>
injure hair unless worn too tight. Pale hair
shows a want of iron in the system, and this is
to be supplied by a free use of beef-steaks,
soups, pure beef gravies, and red wines. Salt-water
bathing strengthens the system, and acts
favorably on the hair. As to color, hardly any
shade is unlovely when luxuriant and in a lively
condition. It is only when diseased or uncared
for that any color appears disagreeable.
Sandy hair, when well brushed and kept glossy
with the natural oil of the scalp, changes to a
warm golden tinge. I have seen a most obnoxious
head of this color so changed by a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>few years’ care that it became the admiration
of the owner’s friends, and could hardly be
recognized as the withered, fiery locks once
worn.</p>

<p>Superfluous hair is as troublesome to those
who have it as baldness is to others. There
is no way to remove it but by dilute acids or
caustics, patiently applied time after time, as
the hair makes its appearance. The mildest
depilatories known are parsley water, acacia-juice,
and the gum of ivy. It is said that nut-oil
will prevent the hair from growing. The
juice of the milk-thistle, mixed with oil, according
to medical authority, prevents the hair
from growing too low on the forehead, or
straggling on the nape of the neck. As Willis
says, Nature often slights this part of her
masterpiece. Muriatic acid, very slightly reduced,
applied with a sable pencil, will destroy
the hair; and, to prevent its growing, the part
may be often bathed with strong camphor or
clear ammonia. The latter will serve as a depilatory,
but causes great pain, and must be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>quickly washed off. The depilatories sold in
the shops are strong caustics, and leave the
skin very hard and unpleasant. Bathe the
upper lip, or other feature afflicted with superfluous
hair, with ammonia or camphor, as
strong as can be borne, and the hair will die
out in a few weeks. Moles, with long hairs
in them, should be touched with lunar caustic
repeatedly. A large, dark mole on a lady’s
neck was reduced to an unnoticeable white
spot, but the nitrate of silver caused a sore
for a week in place of the mole. Care should
be taken to brush the back hair upward from
childhood, to prevent the disfiguring growth
of weak, loose hairs on the neck. Fine clean
wood-ashes, mixed with a little water to form
a paste, makes a tolerable depilatory for
weak hair, without any pain. Strong pearlash
washes also kill out poor hair.</p>

<p>A clever scientific man suggested that the
growth of hair might be hastened by frequently
applying electric currents to it, or bathing
it in electrical water. Similar experiments
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>have been made on vital tissues with remarkable
success. But this theory must be left for
further development.</p>

<p>The eyelashes may be improved by delicately
cutting off their forked and gossamer points,
and anointing with a salve of two drachms of
ointment of nitric oxide of mercury and one
drachm of lard. Mix the lard and ointment
well, and anoint the edges of the eyelids night
and morning, washing after each time with
warm milk and water. This, it is said, will
restore the lashes when lost by disease. The
effect of black lashes is to deepen the color of
gray eyes. They may be darkened for theatricals
by taking the black of frankincense,
resin, and mastic burned together. This will
not come off with perspiration.</p>

<p>Was it not Madame de Genlis who described
the education in manners under the
old régime of France? In her memoirs she
speaks of hating Paris, when she came from
the provinces, for the ordeal she underwent
there to fit her for polite society. She was
taught, what she fancied she knew already,
how to walk, and was placed in the stocks two
or three hours a day to teach her the right position
of her feet in standing. A corset and
back-board were provided to form an erect
habit. Whether in her day or later ones, the
elegancies of manner are not cultivated without
sincere pains. Nature, indeed, creates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>some models of such refined proportions and
such informing spirit that they fall at once
into the curves of grace; but these are meant
for models, and happily nothing forbids those
of lesser merit to attempt the same lesson. Are
not some born masters of the piano, full-flown
at once over the first difficulties of music?
But does this hinder any pupil from six hours’
daily drill, if need be, to grasp the same difficulties?
The one end is to be attained, whether
instantly or not; and in some cases the
most laborious is by all means the most delightful
player. Courage, then. The same
thing is true of other efforts than those of the
key-board; and it is quite as certain that the
woman who trains herself to be graceful will
be so, as that the clumsy young pedant at the
scales will, in time, rush victoriously through
the “Shower of Pearls,” the “Cascade of
Roses,” or any other drawing-room favorite
of gelatinized octaves.</p>

<p>For the first comfort, it must be owned that
American women have the least natural grace
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>of any nation in the world. English women
are usually well trained in a sort of martinet
propriety of attitude which suits their solid
contours; but neither Anglo-Saxon race knows
an approach to those lengthened curves, those
bends of every slender joint and supple muscle,
which fill the eye in looking at a woman
of Latin race. I watched a Spanish-American
girl in the gallery of the United States Senate
one night, in order to seize, if possible, her
charm of gesture. She was rounded, yet fine
in figure, and seemed to be, as I can best
phrase it, all muscle. No one could think of
her bones as having any more stiffness than
the pliant sprays of an elm. She leaned on
the railing of the balcony, not straight forward
as even the elegant and delicate diplomatic
English ladies did, but lengthwise, as if reclining;
and the bend of her supple wrist, with
the black and gold fan, was simply inimitable
to an American woman. Those intransferable
curves bewitched the eye even to pain; but
something was gained in that five minutes’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>study which I reduce to two points: Sideway
movements and attitudes please more
than those either forward or backward. The
secret of grace is to teach every joint of the
body to bend all that it can.</p>

<p>Take the last point first, and you have all
that you need to teach the finest grace. To
the dumb-bells, to the calisthenic exercises and
work as if you were qualifying yourself to be
a contortionist at a circus. Vitalize every
fibre, as the hot-blooded Southerner is vitalized,
and the body will play into grace of itself.</p>

<p>The first thing is the hardest—to stand
straight. Most people are satisfied indeed to
attain this point of physical and polite culture,
and never get beyond it. Erect stiffness is
better than crookedness. To be admirable, the
figure must be perfectly flat in the shoulders.
No projecting shoulder-blades, no curves are allowed
here, however pleasing they may be elsewhere.
A stout figure can hardly be unrefined
if it is flat behind. A pair of inelastic
shoulder-braces must be called into requisition;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>and these should be made of coutille, or
satin jean, two inches wide, and corded at the
edge. Make them barely long enough to reach
the belt of the skirts worn, and button on them.
Set the shoulders perfectly flat against the
wall, and find the distance between their
blades; fasten a broad strap the same length—not
more than two inches, very likely—by
sewing it to the straps behind even with the
lower edge of the scapula. This is the best,
as well as the cheapest shoulder-brace to be
found. If well proportioned, and all the measure
taken scant, it can not fail to draw the
shoulders into place. Excellent teachers of
physical training say that the will alone should
be used to force one’s self to stand straight.
This is true of a person in perfect health.
But round shoulders often result from weakness
or sedentary pursuits, against whose influence
it is useless to struggle; and I would
not debar any half-invalid from the luxury of
the support given by a strict pair of braces.
They relieve the heart and lungs by throwing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>the weight of the chest on the back, where it
belongs, instead of crowding it down on the
breast. To correct the ugly rise of the shoulders
which always accompanies curvature, and
sometimes exists without it, weights must be
used. Nothing is more unfeminine than the
straight line of shoulder, which properly belongs
to a cuirassier or an athlete. Some
mothers make their young folks walk the floor
with a pail of water in each hand, to give their
shoulders a graceful droop. A substitute may
be worn in one’s room while at work, in the
shape of an outside brace of triple gray linen,
having two extra straps buckling round the
tip of each shoulder, one long end reaching the
belt, with a wedge-shaped lead or iron weight
hooked on it. This is heroic practice, but effectual;
and its pains are amply compensated
by lines of figure which are the surest exponents
of high breeding.</p>

<p>The position of the feet is not to be neglected
in the lesson of standing. The toes
should be widely turned out, to balance well;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>and if the foot is inclined to turn in, this may
be remedied by having the boot heels made
higher on the inside. This will throw the
foot into a position to develop the arched instep.
A crooked leg is a matter for surgical
treatment; and in these days of curative ingenuity,
with steel braces it will be but the
work of a few months to bring the most awkward
limb into shape. Those who have seen
the wonders wrought with deformed children
who have crooked limbs and bodies will consider
it a simple matter to bring a partial disfiguration
under control. As to the size of the
feet, sensible people will never be persuaded
that any degree of pressure which can be
borne without suffering is injurious. Nature
knows how to protect herself. A clever old
shoe-dealer gave as his experience that people
who always wear tight shoes never have corns.
It is the alternation of tight and loose shoes
that gives rise to these torments.</p>

<p>The great-toe joint ought not to project beyond
the line of the foot. I know a zealous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>young girl who regularly screwed her bare foot
up in a linen bandage before going to bed, to
keep it in shape. For painful swelling of
the feet in warm weather, no remedy is as
effectual as an ice-cold foot-bath for five minutes
in the evening or when they are most
troublesome. This, however, must never be
taken without first wetting the head plentifully
with ice-water, and keeping a cold bandage
on it all the while. It is good to soak
the feet for fifteen minutes in warm water at
least twice a week. This keeps them elastic,
and in delicate, pliant condition.</p>

<p>An elegant carriage is the patent of nature’s
nobility, and appears of itself when the
body is held into proper attitudes, and made
properly elastic by exercise. The great cause
of all stiffness is want of exertion—a general
rustiness of all the limbs. To the slender
child of the South the climate supplies a degree
of relaxation and suppleness which dispenses
with the need of action. The women
of South American colonies seldom walk for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>exercise, yet their movements are full of
grace. The stimulus of thorough circulation,
so potent and softening, can only be gained
in our colder latitude by exertion. A lazy
woman may be picturesque in a room or in a
carriage, but never on foot. Americans have
one-sided ideas of grace in walking. A woman
as straight as a dart, who moves without
any perceptible movement of the hips or limbs,
is considered an excellent walker. But this
unvarying rectitude is far from the poetry of
motion. Watch the slight <i>balancement</i> of a
graceful French woman, and you will see an
ease, a spontaneity, and variety of motion
which set the former by comparison in the
light of a bodkin out for a “constitutional.”
A fine walk is an affair of proper balance.</p>

<p>A clever friend, who has spent more time
in the study of women’s ways and manners
in different countries than one can think
profitable, has some unique views on the subject
of their walking. He says the haughty
women of Old Spain carry their weight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>mainly on the hips, which gives an indescribable
stiffness of demeanor. Americans
do the same, throwing the weight a little
more on the thigh, without bending the knee.
French women carry the weight on the calf
of the leg, and the knee bends very much at
each step, while the body is carried with the
least <i>balancement</i> of the shoulders, and the
head, so far from being held like a cockade,
or the head of tongs, is easy. <i>La tête dégagée,
les épaules tombante</i> is the rule for a good
style. Try the difference of contracting the
muscles in the calf of the leg in walking, with
the knee bent sensibly at each step. The
body involuntarily throws itself back, and a
lightness of motion is the result, which is impossible
with the usual swing of the leg from
the hips in the stiff walk of Saxon women.
The same authority says that the far-famed
serpentine glide of the creole, which travelers
admire and vainly try to describe, comes from
a peculiar movement of the hips. The weight
of the figure is thrown on the loins, and half
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>of the body moves alternately at each step, not
in a wriggle, as it is caricatured at the North,
but with a soft turn of the shoulders corresponding,
and a smoothness which betrays the
sensuous temperament and luxurious physique.
Such is the walk of the women of Venezuela,
Bogota, and La Plata. Such a gait, however,
would hardly be accepted in the Champs Elysées
as suggestive of high refinement. The
women of Alabama and Georgia have traits
enough of this walk to make them among the
most graceful in the world, as far as carriage
goes. The creoles of the Gulf have this sinuous
glide, betraying a flexibility of limb which we
can scarcely imagine. To gain this pliancy,
twisting movements of gymnastics are especially
suitable. Gyrations of each limb, the
head and body, produce, in a few weeks’ practice,
an enviable degree of elasticity, which
gives the carriage something more than the
up and down, forward and back, straight
lines of motion with which ladies ordinarily
favor us. A smooth, long step, the weight of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>the body on the loins, where nature intended
it should be, and the legs propelled from
thence, without stiffness at the knee or obtrusive
motion of the hips, is, probably, the
ideal of walking; such as one finds both in a
highly trained woman and in the untaught
perfection of a South Sea Islander.</p>

<p>I have spoken at length on the topic of
walking, because its importance as an art of
grace can not be overrated, and because it has
a still deeper bearing on women’s health.
The training which secures an elegant carriage
is precisely that which counteracts the
tendency to a dozen fatal relaxations at different
points of the frame, and prevents their
appearance. No one ought to say that walking
brings on the disorders which blanch and
wither feminine life. The cause is the fatal,
inherited weakness of constitution, shown by
either undue redness or pallor, by indolence
or excitability, which is a slow decay from its
first breath, and poisons the hopes and the
loveliness of so many women. These doomed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>beings must work out their own salvation, and
make themselves anew in the effort. The
weaknesses would develop whether they walked
or not. The care should be to adjust exercise
and nourishment, stimulus and rest, in
due proportion. But the weak woman must
have separate counsel, for she by no means
comes under the head of these unpremeditated
consultations.</p>

<p>When Willis died, American society lost its
great personal critic. No other writer shows
such insight into the subtile elements of women’s
beauty, or speaks so assuredly on points
of mere outward attraction. That gentle and
gracious critic who blesses the order of Old
Bachelors dissects feminine manner with zest,
but is not given to that mention of ear-locks
and finger-tips which made “People I have
Met” such a conserve of hints for the dressing-table.
It is a pity such a connoisseur of
feminine graces could not have taken half a
hundred distinguished specimens into his training
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>to show the world such women as fill the
ideal of a refined man of the world. Willis
was susceptible to beauty wherever he found
it: a perfect ear on the head of a plain country
girl would not miss the glance of this artist,
and he betrays what single charms may
rivet the regard of a man of taste a dozen
times in those glorious sketches we never hope
to see excelled.</p>

<p>You remember one of his heroines was remarkable
for the perfume which exhaled from
her person. We are not to suppose that this
most fascinating gift was due to Coudray’s
sachets, or to hedyosima on her hair. From
repeated experience, verified by that of very
discerning and sensitive persons, it is affirmed
that certain people of fine organism
and perfect health have a fragrance belonging
to their presence like scent to a flower.
One of the most powerful feminine novelists
of the day said that she always knew when a
favorite brother had been in a room by the
slight indefinable perfume that followed him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>His pillow breathed it, and his easy-chair, and
it was perceived even by comparative strangers.
I have known persons innocent of using
perfume, whose fragrant presence was recognized
by every one who came near them. In
all cases this was accompanied by a bodily
condition of perfect health and much magnetic
attraction. This may be named the first
in that list of subtile personal properties which
constitute the strongest and most enduring of
physical charms, and which are not discussed
with any proportion to their potency. We do
not stop to ask what pleases us; refinement
attracts, sweetness detains us, and we are only
too glad to lie under the spell.</p>

<p>May a plain woman reach her hand for
these gifts of pleasing? Surely. They
were meant to be nature’s compensation for
the lack of chiseled features and ruffled
tresses. To reach this subtile refinement requires
such preparation as the virgins underwent
for the court of Ahasuerus: “Six months
with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet
odors”—if not in kind, yet in care.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>
<p>The secret of lively spirits, even temper, and
magnetic presence can never be attained in
the world without a perfect circulation of the
blood. It may be out of season to say that
people often keep themselves too cold; but
lay the hint away till next October, when
the weather changes, and mark the facts.
Our seasons are two thirds cold or chilly; our
habits are sedentary, which tends to reduce
the force of the system; as a people we are
not of excitable temperament; and yet stout
men and hearty doctors, who go rushing
through their business all day, complain because
women sit in overheated rooms, and can
not endure draughts in the halls. There is
but one answer to this: Nature is her own
guide, and it is one of her laws that no
creature can be uncomfortable in any way
without losing by it. If the tone of the
system is so low that a woman feels chilly in
a room at seventy degrees, put the heat at
once up to eighty, or higher, till she feels luxuriously
warm. Chilliness is a symptom to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>be most dreaded. When the blood forsakes
the skin, it clogs the heart, the internal organs,
and lays the train for those diseases of the
time—neuralgia, paralysis, rheumatism, and
congestion. In fact, every person who suffers
from one of these stupid chills is in a state of
incipient congestion. How hateful is the miserable
economy which stints fires in the raw
days of May and September, because the calendar
of household routine decrees that it is
not the season for stoves and grates! Not
less irritating is it to sit with a circle half
shivering in a large parlor, because the full-blooded,
active master of the house has decided
that it is nonsense to turn the heat on. The
slow tortures such unfeeling people inflict on
their innocent victims will be witnesses against
them some day, to their great surprise.</p>

<p>Even in summer many delicate persons
find the skin always cold. Those who are so
susceptible should never be without protection.
The most convenient is a sheet of tissue
paper quilted in marcelline silk, and worn between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>the shoulders, the most sensitive point
of the whole body for feeling cold. The comfort
of this slight device can hardly be imagined.
Paper is a non-conductor of heat, but
porous enough to admit air, so that it never
leaves the dampness of rubber or oil-silk protectors.
Even in winter the warmth of these
slender linings exceeds that of a sheet of wadding.
In the change of the year, when it is
not cold enough for flannel, and one can not
be comfortable without some extra clothing,
this is just what is wanted. A sheet of quilted
paper should be worn for the back, and one for
the chest, the arms cased in the legs cut from
old silk or thread stockings, which cling to the
flesh, and keep it from the air better than any
other article. Thus equipped, a delicate woman
may face the subtle chills of spring and
autumn without a shiver. Added warmth is
not necessary about the trunk of the body till
extreme cold weather. Clothes fit closely
there, and the vital centres always generate
most heat, so that only the extremities and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>the upper part of the chest need protection.</p>

<p>The daily bath needs to be administered
with some care. The value of hot bathing is
hardly understood. In congested circulation
nothing is so effective as a ten minutes’ bath
at eighty-five degrees, the water covering the
body entirely, followed by a cold sponge-bath,
quickly given, and immediate drying. Bath-towels
are not half large enough as commonly
made. They should be small sheets in size, like
the real Turkish bath-towels used by the women
of Constantinople, which envelop the body,
and dry it at once. A bath should never chill
one, and the feelings may be safely trusted as
guides in the matter. To a constitution strong
enough to meet it, even though somewhat depressed
at the time, nothing is so inviting as
the stimulus of the cold bath, the instant’s
chill followed by the rush of warm blood all
over the body. For weak systems an invigorant
is found, so simple and effective that
the wonder is why it was not used long ago.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>When the season or circumstances forbid a
stay on the sea-coast, a substitute nearly if
not quite as strengthening is found in an
ammonia bath. A gill of liquid ammonia in
a pail of water makes an invigorating solution,
whose delightful effects can only be compared
to a plunge in the surf. Weak persons will
find this a luxury and a tonic beyond compare.
It cleanses the skin, and stimulates it
wonderfully. After such a bath the flesh feels
firm and cool like marble. More than this,
the ammonia purifies the body from all odor of
perspiration. Those in whom the secretion is
unpleasant will find relief by using a spoonful
of the tincture in a basin of water, and washing
the armpits well with it every morning.
The feet may be rid of odor in the same way.</p>

<p>But what shall destroy that foe to sentiment,
that bane of all beauty, an offensive
breath? I can not imagine a woman could
fall in love with Hyperion if he had this
drawback. The suggestion of unrefinement
and of physical disorder it gives would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>weigh against all the moral and intellectual
worth which might lie behind it. The antidote,
happily, is as simple as the evil is prevailing.
With attention to the health, and
brushing the teeth at least night and morning,
all besides that is needed to secure a
sweet breath is to dissolve a bit of licorice
the size of a cent in the mouth after using
the tooth-brush. This will even counteract
the effects of indigestion, and does not
convey the unpleasant suggestion of cachous
and spice, that they are used to hide an offense.
Licorice has no smell, but it sweetens the mouth
and stomach. A stick of it should be chipped
for use, and kept in a box on the toilette.</p>

<p>A tincture which restores soundness to the
gums is one ounce of coarsely powdered Peruvian
bark steeped in half a pint of brandy
for a fortnight. Gargle the mouth night and
morning with a teaspoonful of this tincture,
diluted with an equal quantity of rose-water.</p>

<p>For decaying teeth make a balsam of two
scruples of myrrh in fine powder, a scruple of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>juniper gum, and ten grains of rock alum,
mixed in honey, and apply often.</p>

<p>It is useful also to chew a bit of orris-root,
which Browning says Florentine ladies love to
use in mass-time; or to wash the mouth with
the tincture of myrrh, or take a bit of myrrh
the size of a hazel-nut at night, or a piece of
burned alum.</p>

<p>A very agreeable dentifrice is made from
an ounce of myrrh in fine powder and a little
powdered green sage, mixed with two spoonfuls
of white honey. The teeth should be
washed with it every night and morning.</p>

<p>To clean the teeth, rub them with the ashes
of burned bread. It must be thoroughly
burned, not charred.</p>

<p>Spite of all that is said against it, charcoal
holds the highest place as a tooth-powder. It
has the property, too, of opposing putrefaction,
and destroying vices of the gums. It
is most conveniently used when made into
paste with honey.</p>

<p>A fine Cologne is prepared from one gallon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>of deodorized alcohol, or spirit obtained
from the Catawba grape, which is nearly
if not quite equal to the grape spirit which
gives Farina Cologne its value. To this is added
one ounce of oil of lavender, one ounce of
oil of orange, two drachms of oil of cedrat, one
drachm of oil of neroli or orange flowers, one
drachm of oil of rose, and one drachm of ambergris.
Mix well, and keep for three weeks
in a cool place.</p>

<p>To this list of fragrance add a recipe for
common Cologne to use as a toilet water.
It is oil of bergamot, lavender, and lemon, each
one drachm; oil of rose and jasmine, each ten
drops; essence of ambergris, ten drops; spirits
of wine, one pint. Mix and keep well closed
in a cool place for two months, when it will
be fit for use. Ladies will be grateful for this
who have known what trouble it is to find a
refreshing Cologne which does not smell like
cooking extract with lemon or vanilla. If
with these hints a woman can not keep herself
fragrant and lovely in person, her case
must need the help of the physician.</p>

<p>The time has gone by when it was a matter
of church discipline if a woman painted her
face or wore powder. Nor is it any serious
reflection on her moral character if she go
abroad with her complexion made up in the
forenoon, however it may call her taste in
question. All who paint their faces and look
forth at their windows are not visited with
hard names, else the parlor of every house on
the side-streets of New York might have its
Jezebel waiting the dinner-hour and the return
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>of masculine admirers. George declares
he could never own a wife who used powder;
and yet Annie comes down, looking innocent
in her pink bows, with a little white bloom on
each temple, and a suspicious odor of Lubin’s
Violet floating round her. I don’t think
George meditates divorce on that account.
There is something noble and ingenuous in
the sight of an uncovered skin; but we reconcile
ourselves to the pearly falsehood, accepting
the situation with the false hair, not
so gray as it is in front, and the long, artificial-shaped
nails, and the cramped feet. Every
body knows they are inventions, and accepts
them as such, like paste brilliants at a theatre.</p>

<p>The arts of the toilet are as old as Thebes.
The painted eye of desire, the burning cheek
and dyed nails, were coeval with the wisdom
of Alexandria. Of old the Roman ladies
used the fine dust of calcined shells and the
juices of plants to restore their freshness of
color. There is no end to the modern contrivances
for the same purpose. Crushed geranium
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>leaves, and the petals of artificial roses
which contain carmine, friction with red flannel,
and the juice of strawberries, are homely
substitutes for rouge. The women of the
South are more given to the use of cosmetics
than their Northern sisters. Perhaps Washington
sets the example to all the states; for nowhere
else is seen such liberal use of paint and
powder, skillfully applied, as at the capital.
There women paint for the breakfast-table, and
carry the deception every where. The Spanish-American
ladies make the absurd mistake
of supposing their rich complexions and dark
eyes are not more enticing to Northern eyes
than our own cold beauties; so, by the help
of toilet bottles, they present faces like Lady
Washington geraniums from nine in the morning
till they ice themselves to frozen whiteness
for the evenings. Whited sepulchres is
the phrase forever ringing in one’s head at
sight of this folly. What indignation has
seized one at sight of Madame ——, the witty
and enviable, who had the weakness to mask
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>her lustrous, tropical, Murillo colors—which
enchanted every Northern heart—with poor
plaster of burned oyster-shells! It was very
well for the Treasury blondes, who looked like
human peaches till one saw them close, to dabble
in white and pink. It suited their style.
For these superb Creoles and Sevillians, never!</p>

<p>Both from principle and preference, this
book discountenances paint and powder. It
believes that a woman needs no other cosmetics
than fresh air, exercise, and pure water,
which, if freely used, will impart a ruddier
glow and more pearly tint to the face
than all the rouge and lily-white in Christendom.</p>

<p>But if she must resort to artificial beauty,
let her be artistic about it, and not lay on
paint as one would furniture polish, to be rubbed
in with rags. The best and cheapest
powder is refined chalk in little pellets, each
enough for an application. Powder is a protection
and comfort on long journeys or in
the city dust. If the pores of the skin must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>be filled, one would prefer clean dust, to begin
with. A layer of powder will prevent
freckles and sun-burn when properly applied.
It cools feverish skins, and its use can be
condoned when it modifies the contrast between
red arms and white evening dresses.
In amateur theatricals it is indispensable, the
foot-lights throwing the worst construction on
even good complexions. In all these cases it
is worth while to know how to use it well.
The skin should be as clean and cool as possible,
to begin. A pellet of chalk, without any
poisonous bismuth in it, should be wrapped in
coarse linen and crushed in water, grinding it
well between the fingers. Then wash the
face quickly with the linen, and the wet powder
oozes in its finest state through the cloth,
leaving a pure white deposit when dry. Press
the face lightly with a damp handkerchief to
remove superfluous powder, wiping the brows
and nostrils free. This mode of using chalk
is less easily detected than when it is dusted
on dry.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>
<p>The best foundation for Lubin’s powder is
gained by soaping the face well, and taking
care not to rinse off all the smooth, glossy feeling
it leaves. Dry the face without wiping,
and the thinnest layer of oil is left, which
holds the dry powder, without that mealy look
which Lubin is apt to leave. To whiten the
arms for theatricals, rub them first with glycerine,
not letting the skin absorb it all, and
apply chalk. The country practice is to substitute
a tallow candle for the glycerine; but
ours is a progressive age. At least the moral
feeling leads one to spare an escort’s coat-sleeve.</p>

<p>Rouge needs consideration before rashly applying.
There are more tints of complexion
than there are roses, and one can only be successful
by observing the natural colors of a
beauty of her own type. Some cheeks have a
wine-like, purplish glow, others a transparent
saffron tinge, like yellowish-pink porcelain;
others still have clear, pale carmine; and the
rarest of all, that suffused tint like apple blossoms.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>By making her own rouge a lady can
graduate her pallet—that is to say, her cheeks—at
pleasure. The following preparations
have the virtue, at least, of being harmless,
which can not be said of most paints and powders.
Red-lead, bismuth, arsenic, and poisonous
vegetable compounds are used in the common
cosmetics. Bismuth is most frequent;
and its least effect is to give the cheeks it has
whitened a crop of purplish pimples, which
would indicate that the wearer was freely
“dispoged” to the same tastes as Sairey Gamp.
The hideously coarse complexion of many
public singers is partly due to their use of bismuth
powder. An old dispensatory gives the
following formula for a harmless cosmetic under
the name of Almond Bloom:</p>

<p>Take of Brazil dust, one ounce; water,
three pints; boil, strain, and add six drachms
of isinglass, two of cochineal, three of borax,
and an ounce of alum; boil again, and strain
through a fine cloth. Use as a liquid cosmetic.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>
<p>Devoux French rouge is thus prepared:
Carmine, half a drachm; oil of almonds, one
drachm; French chalk, two ounces. Mix.
This makes a dry rouge.</p>

<p>The milk of roses is made by mixing four
ounces of oil of almonds, forty drops of oil of
tartar, and half a pint of rose-water with carmine
to the proper shade. This is very soothing
to the skin. Different tinges may be given
to the rouge by adding a few flakes of indigo
for the deep black-rose crimson, or mixing a little
pale yellow with less carmine for the soft
Greuze tints. All preparations for darkening
the eyebrows, eyelashes, etc., must be put on
with a small hair-pencil. The “dirty-finger”
effect is not good. A fine line of black round
the rim of the eyelid, when properly done,
should not be detected, and its effect in softening
and enlarging the appearance of the eyes
is well known by all amateur players. A
smeared, blotchy look conveys an unpleasant
idea of dissipation.</p>

<p>For the finger-tips, alkanet makes a good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>stain. An eighth of an ounce of chippings
tied in coarse muslin, and soaked for a week
in diluted alcohol, will give a tincture of lovely
dye. The finger-tips should be touched
with jewelers’ cotton dipped in this mixture.</p>

<p>Hair-powder is made from powdered starch,
sifted through muslin, and scented with oil
of roses in the proportion of twelve drops to
the pound. Crystal powder is glass dust, obtained
from factories, or powdered crystallized
salts of different kinds. A golden powder
may be procured by coloring a saturated solution
of alum bright yellow with turmeric,
then allowing it to crystallize, and reducing
it to coarse powder. This certainly has the
merit of cheapness.</p>

<p>Color for the lips is nothing more than cold
cream, with a larger quantity of wax than
usual melted in it, with a few drachms of carmine.
For vermilion tint use a strong infusion
of alkanet instead of poisonous red-lead.
Keep the chippings for a week in the
almond-oil of which the cold cream is made,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>and afterward incorporate with wax and
spermaceti. Always tie alkanet in muslin
when it is used for coloring purposes.</p>

<p>When blonde wigs are not attainable for
theatricals, a switch of dark hair may be
bleached by soaking in strong vinegar, and
colored by an infusion of turmeric in Champagne,
or by the liquor obtained from the tops
of potatoes ready to flower, mixed with water,
suffering it to steep twenty-four hours. This
is too poisonous ever to be used on the head
with safety.</p>

<p>The walnut stain for skin or hair is made
precisely like that for cloth, by boiling the
bark—say an ounce to a pint of water—for
an hour, slowly, and adding a lump of alum
the size of a thimble to set the dye. Apply
with a little brush, such as is used in water-colors,
to the lashes and eyebrows, or with a
sponge to the hair. Wrap the head in an old
handkerchief when going to sleep, or the moisture
of the hair will stain the pillow-cases.</p>

<p>But one thing must be said: the woman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>who has once taken to painting and coloring
must go on painting and coloring; rarely, if
ever, does the complexion regain its bloom,
the skin its smoothness, or the hair its gloss.
In most cases the operator must go on deepening
the hue, and in no case can he or she
be sure of the shade or tint which successive
applications will produce.</p>

<p>The motto that used to haunt our souls
over copy-books, “No excellence without great
labor,” is as true about personal improvement
as any thing else. Few celebrated beauties
have gained their fame without use of those
arts which must be the earliest of all, since we
have no record of their first teaching—the
arts of the toilette. Madame Récamier, who
exercised more power by her beauty than any
woman of modern times, was bred by a most
careful mother, versed in all the mysteries of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>training. Her exceeding delicacy of complexion
arose from the protection she gave it,
never going out except in her carriage, and
scarcely knowing what it was to set foot to
the ground. Margaret of Anjou and Mary
Stuart, in earlier times, were wise as serpents
in the magic of the toilet, disdaining
neither May dew nor less simple lotions for
cheeks whereon the eye of the world was to
dwell. Diana of Poitiers bequeathed a legacy
of value to her sex in commending the
use of the rain-water bath, which preserved
her own beauty till, at the age of sixty-five, no
one could be insensible to her. Ninon de
l’Enclos left the same testimony. It is intolerable
that women have not the ambition to
preserve their health and charms to the latest
date, and give up their cases so shamefully
soon. An intelligent maturity chisels and refines
the face to a high and feeling beauty;
that is to the attractions of youth what the
aristocratic head of Booth would be beside a
pink-and-white lady-killer of society. This serene
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>and finished expression should find physical
favor to accompany it. Nor is this to be
gained, as many say, by leading a passive, emotionless
life. People of vivid feeling are the
youngest. Their quick alterations of mood
make the face clean cut, yet do not settle it in
uniform furrows. Both grief and joy, yearning
passion and utter renunciation, are needed
to sculpture finely the statues for remembrance.
No one professing the loftiest aims,
who understands human nature, can despise
the care of personal beauty when, combined
with moral worth, its influence is so irresistible.
Look at the portraits of those renowned
as moral and intellectual heroes; it will be
found their greatness was rarely associated
with physical repulsiveness, and though their
faces in the conflicts of life grew seamed
and worn, yet in youth they must have been
more than ordinarily remarked for beauty of
a high order—Columbus and Galileo and
Whitefield will do for examples. And if
the reader go through the range of feminine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>celebrities, from the poets to missionary biographies,
“with portrait of the original,” not
one face in ten will dispute what I have
said.</p>

<p>Least of all let any woman heed smiling
scorn of her weakness in taking pains to secure
a good complexion—the real clearness
and color, if she eschew the coarse pretense
of powder and paint. George Eliot, with her
masculine sense, bears witness to the irresistible
tendency to associate a pure soul with a
lucent complexion. No woman can be disagreeable
if she have this saving claim; and
there will be no apology for adding a few estimable
recipes for the purpose from the collection
of a foreign physician, Dr. Cazenave.
He recommends the following as a composition
for the face:</p>

<p>Three ounces of ground barley, one ounce
of honey, and the white of one egg, mixed to
a paste, and spread thickly on the cheeks, nose,
and forehead, before going to bed. This must
remain all night, protecting the face by a soft
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>handkerchief, or bits of lawn laid over the
parts on which the paste is applied. Wash it
off with warm water, wetting the surface with
a sponge, and letting it soften while dressing
the hair or finishing one’s bath. Repeat
nightly till the skin grows perfectly fine and
soft, which should be in three weeks, after
which it will be enough to use it once a week.
Always wash the face with warm water and
mild soap, rubbing on a little cold cream when
exposing one’s self to the weather. This paste
was used by the Romans. With this, care
<i>must</i> be taken to bathe daily in warm water,
using soap freely, toning the system with a
cold plunge afterward, if one can bear it.</p>

<p>For pimples use this recipe: thirty-six grains
of bicarbonate of soda, one drachm of glycerine,
one ounce of spermaceti ointment. Rub
on the face; let it remain for a quarter of an
hour, and wipe off all but a slight film with a
soft cloth.</p>

<p>The best wash for the complexion given is
cascarilla powder, two grains; muriate of ammonia,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>two grains; emulsion of almonds, eight
ounces: apply with fine linen. The frightful
discoloration known as <i>mask</i> is removed by a
wash made from thirty grains of the chlorate
of potash in eight ounces of rose-water. Wrinkles
are less apparent under a kind of varnish
containing thirty-six grains of turpentine in
three drachms of alcohol, allowed to dry on
the face. The black worms called comedones
call forth the simple specific of thirty-six grains
of subcarbonate of soda in eight ounces of distilled
water, perfumed with six drachms of essence
of roses. But I prefer the advice of a
clever home physician, who lately told me that
he removed comedones from the faces of girls
who applied to him for the purpose by touching
the head of each with a fine hair-pencil
dipped in acetic acid—a nice operation, as the
acid must only touch the black spot, or it will
eat the skin. Remembering that Lady Mary
Wortley Montagu quoted the habit of Italian
ladies to renew and refine their complexions
by a wash of vitriol, I begged to know how
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>such a heroic application could safely be made.
The answer was that muriatic acid, sixty per
cent. strong, diluted in twelve parts of water,
might be used as a wash, and gradually eat
away the coarse outer envelope of the skin, if
any one had fortitude to bear a slow cautery
like this. Lady Mary records that she had to
shut herself up most of a week, and her face
meantime was blistered shockingly; but afterward
the Italian ladies assured her that her
complexion was vastly improved. On the
whole, the typhoid fever is preferable as an
agent for clearing the complexion, being perhaps
less dangerous and more effective.</p>

<p>The summer heats, which make nature lovely,
are the bane of our fair-skinned Northern
girls. Southern frames receive the glowing
warmth, and grow paler and paler, because—giving
a matter of fact explanation of a beautiful
appearance—the surface of the skin is
cooled by the perspiration, and the blood retreats
to the central veins. The “shining pallor”
which poets love on the faces of their
favorite creations is the sign and effect of concentrated
passion of any kind in a quick, electric
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>nature. I disbelieved in the expression a
long time, classing it with the “marble flush”
and such freaks of nature in novels; but the
peculiar look has come under my eye more
than once. It is a very striking one, as if the
light came from within—a lustrous, elevated
expression, too ethereal and of the spirit to be
merely high-bred. It is one of the refinements
Nature gives to her ideal pieces of humanity,
and nothing coarse lurks in the creation
of the one who presents it. The Southern
pallor is quite different—a dead but clear
olive, very admirable when the skin is fine.
Northern paleness is relieved rather than disfigured
by a few golden freckles. They are
more piquant than otherwise; and girls with
the pure complexion which attends auburn,
blonde, and brown hair ought to consider them
as caprices of nature to blend the hues of
bright, warm hair and snowy skin. When as
large, and almost as dark as the patches on the
tiger-lily, every one will find them something
to get rid of with dispatch. Freckles indicate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>an excess of iron in the blood, the sun acting
on the particles in the skin as it does on indelible
ink, bringing out the color. A very simple
way of removing them is said to be as follows:</p>

<p>Take finely powdered nitre (saltpetre), and
apply it to the freckles by the finger moistened
with water and dipped in the powder. When
perfectly done and judiciously repeated, it will
remove them effectually without trouble.</p>

<p>An old English prescription for the skin
is to take half a pint of blue skim-milk,
slice into it as much cucumber as it will
cover, and let it stand an hour; then bathe
the face and hands, washing them off with
fair water when the cucumber extract is dry.
The latter is said to stimulate the growth
of hair where it is lacking, if well and frequently
rubbed in. It would be worth while
to apply it to high foreheads and bald crowns.</p>

<p>Rough skins, from exposure to the wind in
riding, rowing, or yachting, trouble many ladies,
who will be glad to know that an application
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>of cold cream or glycerine at night,
washed off with fine carbolic soap in the morning,
will render them presentable at the breakfast-table,
without looking like women who
follow the hounds, blowzy and burned. The
simplest way to obviate the bad effects of too
free sun and wind, which are apt on occasion
to revenge themselves for the neglect too often
shown them by the fair sex, is to rub the
face, throat, and arms well with cold cream or
pure almond-oil <i>before</i> going out. With this
precaution one may come home from a berry-party
or a sail without a trace of that ginger-bread
effect too apt to follow those pleasures.
Cold cream made from almond-oil, with no
lard or tallow about it, will answer every end
proposed by the use of buttermilk, a favorite
country prescription, but one which young ladies
can hardly prefer as a cosmetic on account
of its odor.</p>

<p>A delicate and effective preparation for
rough skins, eruptive diseases, cuts, or ulcers is
found in a mixture of one ounce of glycerine,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>half an ounce of rosemary-water, and twenty
drops of carbolic acid. In those dreaded irritations
of the skin occurring in summer, such
as hives or prickly heat, this wash gives soothing
relief. The carbolic acid neutralizes the
poison of the blood, purifies and disinfects the
eruption, and heals it rapidly. A solution of
this acid, say fifty drops to an ounce of the
glycerine, applied at night, forms a protection
from musquitoes. Though many people consider
the remedy equal to the disease, constant
use very soon reconciles one to the creosotic
odor of the carbolic acid, especially if the pure
crystallized form is used, which is far less overpowering
in its fragrance than the common
sort. Those who dislike it too much to use
it at night, will find the sting of the bites almost
miraculously cured and the blotches removed
by touching them with the mixture in
the morning. This is penned with grateful
recollection of its efficiency after the bites of
Jersey musquitoes a few nights ago. Babies
and children should be touched with it in reduced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>form, to relieve the pain they feel from
insect bites, but do not know how to express
except by worrying. Two or three drops of
attar of roses in the preparation disguises the
smell so as to render it tolerable to human beings,
though not so to musquitoes.</p>

<p>Ladies who find that sea air turns their hair
gray, or who are fearful of such a result, should
keep it carefully oiled with some vegetable oil;
not glycerine, as that combines with water too
readily to protect the locks. The recipe for
cold cream made with more of the almond-oil,
so as to form a salve, is not a bad sea-dressing
for the hair, and the spermaceti and wax render
it less greasy than ordinary preparations.
Animal pomades grow rancid, and make the
head most unpleasant to touch and smell.</p>

<p>Many preparations are given to restore the
color to dark hair when it is lost through ill
health or over-study. The fashionables to-day,
with true taste, admire gray hair when in
profusion, and deem it distinguished when accompanied
by dark eyes, to which the contrast
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>adds a piercing lustre. But those who consider
themselves defrauded of their natural tints may
use this recipe: Tincture of acetate of iron,
one ounce; water, one pint; glycerine, half an
ounce; sulphuret of potassium, five grains.
Mix well, and let the bottle remain uncovered
to pass out the foul smell arising from the potassium.
Afterward add a few drops of ambergris
or attar of roses. Rub a little of this
daily into the hair, which it will restore to its
original color, and benefit the health of the
scalp.</p>

<p>Ladies are annoyed by the tendency of their
hair to come out of crimp or curl while boating
or horseback-riding. The only help is to
apply the following bandoline before putting
the hair in papers or irons: A quarter of an
ounce of gum-tragacanth, one pint of rose-water,
five drops of glycerine; mix and let stand
overnight. If the tragacanth is not dissolved,
let it be half a day longer; if too thick, add
more rose-water, and let it be for some hours.
When it is a smooth solution, nearly as thin as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>glycerine, it is fit to use. This is excellent for
making the hair curl. Moisten a lock of hair
with it, not too wet, and brush round a warm
curling-iron, or put up in papillotes. If the
curl come out harsh and stiff, brush it round
a cold iron or curling-stick with a very little
of the cosmetic for keeping stray hair in place,
or cold cream. To the recipe given in the last
chapter another is added, of perhaps finer proportions:
Oil of sweet almonds, five parts;
spermaceti, three parts; white wax, half a part;
attar of roses, three to five drops. Melt together
in a shallow dish, over hot water, strain
through a piece of muslin when melted, and
as it begins to cool beat it with a silver spoon
till quite cold and of a snowy whiteness. It
is well to rub it smooth on a slab of marble
or porcelain before putting in glass boxes to
keep. For the hair use seven parts of almond-oil
to the other proportions named. The secret
of making fine cold cream lies in stirring
and beating it well all the time it is cooling.</p>

<p>Those who have the misfortune to contract
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>cutaneous disorders arising from exposure to
the contact of the low and degraded—and
charitable persons sometimes run narrow risks
of this kind—or from scorbutic affections or
the fumes of certain medicines, each and any of
which are liable to produce roughness and inflammation
of the skin, will be glad of a speedy
and certain cure for their affliction. It is a
wash of sulphurous acid (not sulphuric), diluted
in the proportion of three parts of soft water
to one of the acid, and used three or four times
a day till relieved. I knew a young lady
whose fine complexion was ruined by the
fumes of medicine she administered to her
grandmother, whom she tended with religious
care; and, thinking there may be others in
like case, hasten to give this prescription. <i>Sub
rosa</i>—all parasites on furniture, human beings,
or pets are quickly destroyed by this application.</p>

<p>It is a wonder that so few educated people
address themselves to the service of beauty in
the human form. It is refined to study draperies
or design costumes for the adornment
of the body, but not to develop the perfection
of the body itself. Hair-dressers, perfumers,
and tailors find ample consolation for being
the ninth part of men, or something less, in
public estimation, since the world finds their
work a necessity, and amply repays it. Who
make fortunes faster among the working-classes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>than those who minister to the desire for
beauty, let us call it, rather than the severer
name of vanity? The arts of the toilet are
advanced to the rank of a profession abroad.
English fashion journals declare this in their
advertisements. Establishments in London
and at fashionable watering-places offer brightly
furnished parlors where one may enjoy the
luxurious soothing of every appliance of the
toilet in succession. The warm bath, in all
the appealing pleasure of marble, porcelain,
and gold, instead of dingy oil-cloths and
reeking zinc basins, gives place to the deft
hands of the hair-bather and the chiropodist,
and these to the dresser, who arranges the
locks, quickly and artificially dried, in the
most elegantly simple style. Then comes the
cosmetic artist, who removes blotches and
specks from the face with quick acids, laves
it with soothing washes, or applies emollient
pastes which leave soft freshness behind. The
vulgarity of paint and enamel is not allowed
in these establishments, though the operators
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>have good knowledge of all secrets of their
art. Innoxious dyes are used as novices never
can apply them, superfluous hairs are removed,
and eyebrows and eyelashes are cared for by
the most skillful hands. The former have every
unnecessary hair removed, and are thinned
to the penciled line they form in the portraits
of Venetian ladies, who secured this peculiar
charm in the same way. If I could only find
out how Petrarch’s Laura trimmed her eyebrows,
and give the method to my readers!</p>

<p>With a pair of fairy-like scissors the lashes
are trimmed a hair-breadth, and brushed with
sable pencils conveying an ointment which increases
their growth. The nails are polished,
and the hands indued with soft and perfumed
oils which leave no trace. Picture the luxury
of such a place and such attention, instead of
the frowzy rooms and careless servants of a
common hair-dressing saloon! The magnetic
benefit of such operations ought to count for
much in elegant physical culture. It unmistakably
soothes the system, and freshens its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>powers better than any narcotic stimulant.
More than one of the most brilliant writers of
the time is in the habit of bathing and making
a full toilet before composition, feeling
its magic influence on the mind in rendering
one’s thoughts bright and happy.</p>

<p>But blessed water and simples, chemicals
and strokings, do their work in stone-ware and
top bedrooms as well as in baths lined with
porcelain behind the portière of a Pompadour
dressing-room. Clever girls can do much for
each other in these matters; and let me hope
no one will have to ask more than sixteen people
before finding a friend with nerve enough
to trim her eyelashes for her, as an ambitious
maiden once did. A fresh handful of prescriptions
for these amateurs is taken from
Paris authorities.</p>

<p>Cosmetic gloves for which there is such
demand are spread inside with the following
preparation: The yolks of two fresh eggs
beaten with two teaspoonfuls of the oil of
sweet almonds, one ounce of rose-water, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>thirty-six drops of tincture of benzoin. Make a
paste of this, and either anoint the gloves with
it, or spread it freely on the hands and draw
the gloves on afterward. Of course there is no
virtue in the gloves save as they protect the
hands from drying or soiling the bed-linen.</p>

<p>A paste for the skin of the shoulders and
arms is made from the whites of four eggs
boiled in rose-water, with the addition of a
grain or two of alum, beaten till thick. Spread
this on the skin and cover with old linen.
Wear it overnight, or all the afternoon before
a party where one desires to appear in full
dress. This cosmetic gives great firmness and
purity to the skin, and may be used to advantage
by persons having soft, flabby flesh.</p>

<p>A wash to stimulate the growth of hair in
case of baldness is made from equal parts of
the tincture of sulphate of quinine and aromatic
tincture.</p>

<p>For causing the eyebrows to grow when
lost by fire, use the sulphate of quinine—five
grains in an ounce of alcohol.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>
<p>For the eyelashes, five grains of the sulphate
in an ounce of sweet almond-oil is the best
prescription; put on the roots of the lashes
with the finest sable pencil. This must be
lightly applied, for it irritates the eye to finger
it.</p>

<p>The best dye is this French recipe, which is
seen to be harmless at a glance: Melt together,
in a bowl set in boiling water, four ounces
of white wax in nine ounces of olive-oil, stirring
in, when melted and mixed, two ounces
of burned cork in powder. This will not take
the dull bluish tinge of metallic dyes, but
gives a lustrous blackness to the hair like life.
To apply it, put on old gloves, cover the shoulders
carefully to protect the dress, and spread
the salvy preparation like pomade on the head,
brushing it well in and through the hair. It
changes the color instantly, as it is a black
dressing rather than a dye. A brown tint
may be given by steeping an ounce of walnut
bark, tied in coarse close muslin, in the oil for
a week before boiling. The bark is to be had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>at any large drug-store, for about thirty cents
an ounce.</p>

<p>The recipes which follow will be of special
value in the warm days of early spring. The
first contains nearly all the vegetable medicines
in common use for purifying the blood,
and will prevent the lassitude and bilious
symptoms which overcloud many a sweet
spring day. When made by one’s own hand,
so that the purity and excellence of the ingredients
can be insured, the mixture is far better
than most of the blood-purifiers and tonics
prescribed by the faculty. It is given here
because it removes the sallowness and unhealthy
iris hues of the complexion at a season
when a girl’s cheek should wear its brightest,
clearest flame.</p>

<p>Half an ounce each of spruce, hemlock, and
sarsaparilla bark, dandelion, burdock, and yellow
dock, in one gallon of water; boil half an
hour, strain hot, and add ten drops of oil of
spruce and sassafras mixed. When cold, add
half a pound of brown sugar and half a cup
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>of yeast. Let it stand twelve hours in a jar
covered tight, and bottle. Use this freely as
an iced drink. This is a good recipe for the
root beer which New Yorkers like to taste
during warm months.</p>

<p>People inclined to embonpoint feel the burden
of mortality oppressive during the first
heats of the calendar. They will be glad to
hear from a hill-country doctor, whose praise
is in many households, that a strong decoction
of sassafras drunk frequently will reduce the
flesh as rapidly as any remedy known. Take
it either iced or hot, as fancied, with sugar if
preferred. It is not advisable, however, to
take this tea in certain states of health, and
the family physician should be consulted before
taking it. A strong infusion is made at
the rate of an ounce of sassafras to a quart of
water. Boil it half an hour very slowly, and
let it stand till cold, heating again if desired,
and keeping it from the air.</p>

<p>A trouble scarcely to be named among refined
persons is profuse perspiration, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>ruins clothing and comfort alike. For this it
is recommended to bathe the feet, hands, and
parts of the body where the secretion is greatest
with cold infusion of rosemary, sage,
or thyme, and afterward dust the stockings
and under-garments with a mixture of two
and a half drachms of camphor, four ounces
of orris-root, and sixteen ounces of starch, the
whole reduced to impalpable powder. Tie it
in a coarse muslin bag, and shake it over the
clothes. This makes a very fine bathing-powder.</p>

<p>Is there such a being as a hopelessly homely
woman? In the light of modern appliances,
study the faces and figures one meets on a
journey from the sea-board to the interior,
and confess that there are few fatally ugly
women. On the railway I often amuse myself,
in default of better things, by considering
how hygiene, cosmetics, and good taste in
dress would transform the common-looking
women about one into charming and even
striking personages. In most of them, all that
is wanting is strength of expression and a clear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>complexion, two things with which no woman
can be wholly unattractive. The one is the
sign of mental, the other of physical health.
No wonder nature makes them so winning.
To show what I mean, let us mention some
common faults, and their antidotes. Nothing
is more delightful than pulling our neighbors
to pieces, with a good motive for it.</p>

<p>Christiana is over thirty—no reason in the
least why she should not be as admired as a
three days’ rose, for one of the most beautiful
women in New York, whom every one is infatuated
with, is over sixty. Yet nobody thinks
of Christiana’s looks, for the simple reason
that she has given up thinking of them herself—believing
her poor skin can not be improved,
nor the stiff, high carriage of her
shoulders be changed. The depth of her eyes
and her really good color are lost with these
defects. To judge how the remedies should
be applied, scrutinize her entire mode of living.
Sunrise, in January or June, and she is
not up! This will never serve a candidate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>for beauty. The first rays of the sun, the
purity of early air, have as potent an effect
on the complexion as the noon rays on the
webs of linen in the bleaching-ground. By
all means, if one must rob daylight for sleep,
take the hours from ten to three, but see the
fires in the east from out-of-doors, even if your
head touched the pillow only two hours before.
I don’t believe in any special morality in
getting up early, but I do know its benefits
on nerves and circulation of the blood. There
is a tonic in the dew-cool air, a lingering of
night’s romance, that stirs while it soothes the
blood like a fine magnetic hand.</p>

<p>But getting up and staying in the house
won’t improve one’s complexion. How much
of her rose-and-lily face the English peasant
woman owes to her walk to the reaping-field
at daybreak is well known. After the first
soft days of February and March there is nothing
to hinder Christiana from reading her
prayer-book or morning paper on the porch in
the sunlight, if she choose to do this rather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>than rake the dead leaves from the grass,
sweep the steps, or do something to stir her
laggard blood. If it is cold, let her plant herself
at the sunniest window, sew, run her machine,
lounge, and eat there, till she is no more
afraid of sunshine than of any other blood relation.
Our women want to imitate French
sense, and sit in the balconies and parks to do
their work. When they lose the detestable
vice of self-consciousness that saps American
well-being in all ways, they will be able to
live at their casements, sewing, singing, reading,
as thoughtless and unnoticed as the white
doves soaring above them where the sunshine
is widest. It is matter of custom merely.</p>

<p>But Christiana’s breakfast is ready by this
time, and we will see what she eats. Coffee:
well, housekeepers buy the ready-ground coffee
now, and it is mixed trash, wanting the
heartiness of a good pure cup, but no great
harm at worst. Meat: do you call that bit
the width of two fingers, crisped, greased at
one end, raw and bleeding at the other, fit sustenance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>for a woman who is to grow, work,
walk, dance, and sing to-day? She is made to
live neither on leather nor raw meat. Cook a
slice of thick beef-steak as quickly as possible
till the color is changed all the way through
without drying any of the juice. The albumen
of the blood must be coagulated before
meat is fit for human stomachs, and proper
cooking means something more than mere
warming through, and a great deal less than
crisping. Now let at least a quarter of a
pound of this browned and fragrant sacrifice
be cut for this young woman—better if she
eat half a pound—to be converted into energetic
work and Christian good-humor in the
course of the day. One, two, three, four slices
of fried potato withered in fat! And this is
what some people call nourishment! Put on
her plate two baked potatoes of unimpeachable
quality—poor potatoes are poison—and let
each be the size of her small fist. Where are
the tomatoes, the celery, the artichokes, salads,
and sauces? She has tomatoes, three bits in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>a tiny saucerette, as if it held some East Indian
condiment. There ought to be a saucer
piled with them, or some savory vegetable delicately
cooked; for breakfast ought to be next
to the heartiest meal of the day. It is far the
best way to take coffee and bread on rising,
and eat the meal later when one has worked
into an appetite for it. Those who find it impossible
to alter their habits enough for this
usually have duties which ought to call them
up long enough before to be quite hungry by
seven or eight o’clock, the usual hours in this
country for breakfast.</p>

<p>Take away that thin slip of toast; it makes
one turn invalid to see it. What do you call
this gray, broad-celled, pallid stuff? Bread—good
yeast bread? If there is any thing intolerable,
it is what the makers of it commonly
call good home-made bread. It is mealy, or
bitter, or gray and coarse-grained, sad-looking,
with white crust, as if the owners were too
poor to afford fire to bake it thoroughly. Give
me poor bread, and I can eat it in a spirit of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>resignation; but this domestic hypocrisy of
good bread libels the wheat that made it, and
arraigns the taste of those who eat it. Were
it ever so good, there is something better yet—the
crisp, unbolted cake that lingers with nutty
richness on the palate, once tasting of which
weans one from the impoverished gentility
of white bread forever. It is not urged on
the score of being wholesome. The phrase has
been so much abused that the cry of “healthful
food” invariably suggests something which
doesn’t taste good. But the strength and
richness and coloring of wheat-cake recommend
it to any breakfast fancier. There is
no use aiming at fine-grained complexions
without the use of coarse bread at every meal.
A slice of Graham bread at breakfast will
not counteract the evil tendencies of incorrect
diet the rest of the day. When you get your
coarse bread, two or three slices will not be
too much at a meal. Such ought to be the
breakfast of a young lady who wishes to have
roundness of contour, unfailing spirits, and self-command,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>with ready strength for walking,
working, or study. Brain-work takes food as
much as bodily labor. Between Mrs. O’Flaherty
in the laundry and the faithful lady editor
of a newspaper, it is probable that the former
has the easiest time of it, and uses less strength.
The women worth any thing are built and
sustained by hearty feeding. It is so that singers
and dancers eat, and lecturers and authors—Grisi
and Jenny Lind, Mrs. Kemble and
Ristori, Mrs. Edwards, the novelist, and with
her nearly every writer of note at this day.
They are well-nourished women, whose appetites
would embarrass the candy-loving sylphs
whose usefulness amounts to nothing more
than that of cheap porcelain. Women who
exercise little, of course eat little; in the end
they can do nothing, because they are not
sufficiently fed. There is no grossness in eating
largely if one work well enough to consume
the strength afforded. The best engines
are best fed. The grossness lies in eating and
being idle. A woman who limits her exertions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>to a walk around the squares daily may
confine herself to a slice of toast and a strip of
meat. She will grow thin and watery-looking,
nervous and “high-strung,” to pay for it.
To know what charm there is in womanhood,
go among the girls brought up in villages
along the coast. The well-poised shoulders
that have a will of their own, the round arms
and necks, the profusion of hair, the strength
and nerve combined in their movements, give
one the idea of walking statuary. The poor
drooping figures, the stiff shoulders we complain
of, come from one cause—lack of nutrition.
Their muscles are not strong enough to
hold them erect, and their nerves are not fed
enough to stimulate the weak muscles to activity.
How many times must it be said over?
Want of sunshine and nourishing food gives
the coarse, uninteresting look to most American
women.</p>

<p>If Christiana would invoke mechanical aid
to bring down her high shoulders and put flexibility
into her chest muscles, after thirty years
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>of abuse, it is easily done. Walking with a
pail of water in each hand is rather dull work
unless there is a call for domestic help. A
homely but very effectual way of educating
the muscles is to wear weights fastened to the
shoulders. A shawl-strap answers every purpose,
buckled on the shoulders with the handle
between them on the back, and fastening a
flat-iron of five or six pounds’ weight to the
straps which hang under the arms. An extra
buckle may be sewed half-way down each
strap, to fasten the iron on the end by a second
loop. The weights may be worn while reading
or writing for hours, and will be found
rather agreeable to balance the stooping propensity
by throwing the stress on fresh muscles.
With or without it, nine tenths of women
from eighteen years old upward will need another
simple support to relieve the muscles of
the trunk below the waist. It matters little
what causes this feebleness, whether too hard
work, the weight of skirts, or degeneration of
the muscular fibre from want of exercise and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>lack of fresh air. Its relief is imperative to
preserve bloom and life of any kind worth
calling life. If any girl or woman can not
dance, run up stairs, take long walks, or stand
about the house-work, no matter how slight
the fatigue, support must be provided. Women
wear corsets, and say they can not exist
without them, when the demand for aid of
the relaxed muscles of the hips and back,
though far more imperative, is neglected. The
means are very simple: a bandage of linen
toweling, soft and cool, buckled, tied, or pinned,
as tight as will be comfortable, and so
arranged as to relieve every muscle that feels
fatigue. This is worth all the manufactured
appliances in the market, and its prompt use
averts a hundred distressing consequences. At
the first approach of debility these girdles
should be worn, as they have been from ancient
times among Greek and Jewish women.
It is not sure that their office of prevention is
not more essential than that of cure. Tight
corsets are an abomination, for they interfere
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>with flexibility, and so with that constant exercise
of the trunk muscles which alone can
keep them in tone—keep them from degeneration
and atrophy. As to the muscles of the
back and abdomen affected by the girdle, a
degree of support just sufficient to encourage
them to their work, and prevent their
giving it up in fatigue and despair, will exercise
and strengthen them. A bandage tighter
than is needed for this will do harm, not
only by keeping the muscles idle, and so
weakening them, but by compressing the abdominal
viscera, and thus producing numerous
evils.</p>

<p>There is a game children play called “wring
the towel,” in which two clasp hands and whirl
their arms over their heads without losing
hold, that every woman ought to practice to
keep her muscles flexible. Hardly any exercise
could be devised which would give play
to so many muscles at once. A woman ought
to be as lithe from head to heel as a willow
wand, not for the sake of beauty only, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>for the varied duties and functions she must
perform.</p>

<p>It would be an artistic feat to take Christiana
through a course of baths, diet, sun-sittings,
and open-air walks, to show her to herself.
The oleander glow on firm cheeks, the
eye of light, the tread of Diana, the buoyancy
of body that fosters buoyancy of mind and
spirits, would please her with herself.</p>

<p>How dexterously Nature inserts the reward
of beauty before the self-denials needed to
gain health! A thoroughly healthy woman
never is unbeautiful. She is full of life, and
vivacity shines in her face and manner, while
her magnetism attracts every creature who
comes within its influence.</p>

</div>


<p>Was the last chapter too much of a sermon
on Christiana’s breakfast? You think so,
Kate, who are longing to learn some art that
may make you the bonniest Kate in Christendom.
You say your hands are rough and unsightly,
your hair grows where you do not
want it, and is none too thick where it ought
to be. Your eyebrows are bushy—a most unfeminine
trait, that makes you look fierce as a
lamb with mustaches. You don’t seem lovely
to yourself, and this consciousness makes you
stiff and shy in your manner. Somebody is
to blame for this state of things. Either your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>mother, or your aunt, or the lady principal of
the school where you studied, ought to have
taken you in hand before you were fourteen,
and showed you the remedies for these defects
that were to affect your spirits and comfort in
after-life. A girl should be taught to take
care of her skin and hair just as she is to hold
her dress out of the dust, and not to crumple
her sash when she sits down. One thing will
not make her vain more than another. There
are many vanities to be found in women’s
character. One is vain of knowing three
languages, one of her Sunday-school devotion,
another of her pattern temper, and one of her
pretty face. Of all these errors, the last is
most endurable. Every attraction filched from
a girl by neglect or design is so much stolen
from her dowry that never can be replaced.</p>

<p>Victor Hugo says that he who would know
suffering should learn the sorrows of women.
Let him say of ugly women, and he will touch
the depth of bitterness. What tears the plain
ones shed on silent pillows, shrinking even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>from the pale, beautiful moonshine that contrasts
so fatally with their homeliness. They
would give years of life to win one of beauty.
This regret is natural, irresistible, and not to
be forbidden. Better let the grief have its
way till the busy period of life takes a woman’s
thoughts off herself, and she forgets to
care whether she is beautiful or not. Dam
up the sluices of any sorrow, and it deepens
and grows wider. Is this treating a peculiarly
feminine regret over-tenderly? This is written
in remembrance of a girl who thought herself
so homely that she absolutely prayed that
she might die and go to be perfect in heaven.
More than one girl makes such a wish this
night before small mirrors in cottage or mansion
chambers, with no eye but her own to
scan her hopeless features. Why doesn’t some
one open a school of fine arts, literally <i>des
beaux-arts</i>, and make a greater success than
Worth, by improving wearers instead of costumes?</p>

<p>Till that time comes, let us make the best of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>present resources, and consider these recipes,
unearthed from an ancient book-shelf belonging
to a maiden lady who was once, if tradition
may be credited, a beauty of no mean order.
There is one thing to console us, Kate:
you and I will never have to cry for our lost
beauty. Your hands are to be pitied, for soft,
sensitive fingers are what a woman can least
afford to lose. They are needed to nurse sick
folks, and do quick sewing, and handle children
with. So we are glad to learn something
of this kind.</p>

<p>To soften the hands, fill a wash-basin half
full of fine white sand and soap-suds as hot as
can be borne. Wash the hands in this five
minutes at a time, brushing and rubbing them
in the sand. The best is flint sand, or the
white powdered quartz sold for filters. It may
be used repeatedly by pouring the water away
after each washing, and adding fresh to keep
it from blowing about. Rinse in warm lather
of fine soap, and after drying rub them in
dry bran or corn meal. Dust them, and finish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>with rubbing cold cream well into the skin.
This effectually removes the roughness caused
by house-work, and should be used every day,
first removing ink or vegetable stains with
acid.</p>

<p>Always rub the spot with cold cream or oil
after using acid on the fingers. The cream
supplies the place of the natural oil of the
skin, which the acid removes with the stain.</p>

<p>To give a fine color to the nails, the hands
and fingers must be well lathered and washed
with scented soap; then the nails must be
rubbed with equal parts of cinnabar and emery,
followed by oil of bitter almonds. To
take white specks from the nails, melt equal
parts of pitch and turpentine in a small cup;
add to it vinegar and powdered sulphur. Rub
this on the nails, and the specks will soon disappear.
Pitch and myrrh melted together
may be used with the same results.</p>

<p>An embrocation for whitening and softening
the hands and arms, which dates far back,
possibly to King James’s times, is made from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>myrrh, one ounce; honey, four ounces; yellow
wax, two ounces; rose-water, six ounces.
Mix the whole in one well-blended mass for
use, melting the wax, rose-water, and honey
together in a dish over boiling water, and adding
the myrrh while hot. Rub this thickly
over the skin before going to bed. It is good
for chapped surfaces, and would make an excellent
mask for the face.</p>

<p>To improve the skin of the hands and arms,
the following old English recipe is given, the
principle of which is now revived in different
cosmetic combinations. Take two ounces of
fine hard soap—old Windsor or almond soap—and
dissolve it in two ounces of lemon juice.
Add one ounce of the oil of bitter almonds,
and as much oil of tartar. Mix the whole, and
stir well till it is like soap, and use it to wash
the hands. This contains the most powerful
agents which can safely be applied to the skin,
and it should not be used on scratches or chapped
hands. For the latter a delicate ointment
is made from three ounces of oil of sweet almonds,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>an ounce of spermaceti, and half an
ounce of rice flour. Melt these over a slow
fire, keep stirring till cold, and add a few drops
of rose-oil. This makes a good color for the
lips by mixing a little alkanet powder with it,
and may be used to tinge the finger-tips. It
is at least harmless.</p>

<p>Oil of almonds, spermaceti, white wax, and
white sugar-candy, in equal parts, melted together,
form a good white salve for the lips
and cheeks in cold weather. A fine cold cream,
much pleasanter to use than the mixtures of
lard and tallow commonly sold under that
name, is thus made:</p>

<p>Melt together two ounces of oil of almonds
and one drachm each of white wax and spermaceti;
while warm add two ounces of rose-water,
and orange-flower water half an ounce.
Nothing better than this will be found in the
range of toilet salves.</p>

<p>A wash “for removing tan, freckles, blotches,
and pimples,” as the high-sounding preface
assures us, is made from two gallons of strong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>soap-suds, to which are added one pint of alcohol
and a quarter of a pound of rosemary.
Apply with a linen rag. This is better when
kept in a close jar overnight.</p>

<p>Freckle lotion, for the cure of freckles, tan,
or sunburned face and hands—something
which I would prefer to the rosemary wash before
given, is thus made: Take half a pound
of clear ox gall, half a drachm each of camphor
and burned alum, one drachm of borax,
two ounces of rock-salt, and the same of rock-candy.
This should be mixed and shaken well
several times a day for three weeks, until the
gall becomes transparent; then strain it very
carefully through filtering-paper, which may be
had of the druggists. Apply to the face during
the day, and wash it off at night.</p>

<p>Now, Kate, do you see your way clear to the
use and benefit of these mixtures? All these
articles are to be found at any large druggist’s,
or, if not, he will tell you where to find them.
The rosemary and honey may be found in that
still fragrant store-room of your aunt’s, in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>country, unless she has taken to writing very
poor serial articles, and let the herb garden and
the bees run out. To save trouble, take the
recipes and have them made up at once by the
druggist, who understands such things; but it
is pleasant to dabble in washes and lotions
one’s self, like the Vicar of Wakefield’s young
ladies. Then have you patience to persevere
in their use? For making one’s self beautiful
is a work of time and perseverance as much
as being an artist, or a student, or a Christian.
I wish I were with you, and could keep you
up to your preparations, brush your eyebrows,
trim your eyelashes, and do the dozen different
offices of sympathy and womanly kindness. I
should feel that I was the artist putting the
touches on something more valuable than any
statue ever moulded. Can you feel so yourself?
For if you can once get hold of that
artistic impulse, you have the secret of all these
toilet interferences.</p>

<p>Neither distilled waters perfumed like May,
nor embrocation smoother than velvet, are this
time to be offered you. The compound in its
ugliness is more like a witch’s potion, and the
odor is generally liked by those only who are
used to it. But its merits are equal to its ugliness—nay,
so firmly am I persuaded of its effectiveness
that before sundown I doubt not
its virtues will be in active test within this
household. Sea winds will roughen the face,
and miscellaneous food deteriorate the softest
skins. There are wrinkles, too, showing
their first faint daring on the brow before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>the glass—wrinkles which had no business
there for ten years to come, at any
rate. “What hand shall soothe” their trace
away?</p>

<p>It is a hunter’s prescription that comes
in use. You will hear of it along the Saranac,
or up in the Franconia region, where the
pines and spruces yield fresh resins for its
making. It is popular there for its efficacy
in keeping the black-flies and musquitoes away;
yet even hunters bear witness to its excellence
in leaving the skin fair and innocent. Thus
runs the formula, simple enough, in all conscience,
yet how few will have the boldness to
try it: Mix one spoonful of the best <i>tar</i> in a
pint of pure olive or almond-oil, by heating the
two together in a tin cup set in boiling water.
Stir till completely mixed and smooth, putting
in more oil if the compound is too thick to
run easily. Rub this on the face when going
to bed, and lay patches of soft old cloth on
the cheeks and forehead to keep the tar from
rubbing off. The bed-linen must be protected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>by old sheets folded and thrown over the pillows.
The odor, when mixed with oil, is not
strong enough to be unpleasant—some people
fancy its suggestion of aromatic pine breath—and
the black, unpleasant mask washes off
easily with warm water and soap. The skin
comes out, after several applications, soft, moist,
and tinted like a baby’s. Certainly this wood
ointment is preferable to the household remedy
for coarse skins of wetting in buttermilk.
Further, it effaces incipient wrinkles by softening
and refining the skin. The French have
long used turpentine to efface the marks of
age, but the olive-tar is pleasanter. A pint
of best olive-oil costs about forty cents at the
grocer’s; for the tar apply to the druggist,
who keeps it on hand for inhaling. A spoonful
of the mixture put in the water vase of a
stove gives a faint pine odor to the air of a
room, which is very soothing to weak lungs.
Physicians often recommend it.</p>

<p>What is to be done with the malignant little
red pimples that crop out annoyingly at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>the close of warm weather? The cause is very
plain. When cool days check the perspiration,
the system must send out matter by some
other outlet before it can adjust itself to the
new state of things. Nothing is better for the
irritable face than bathing with a dilution of
carbolic acid—one teaspoonful of the common
acid to a pint of rose-water. The acid,
as usually sold in solution, is about one half
the strength of really pure acid, which is very
hard to find. The recipe given above was
furnished by a regular physician, and was
used on a baby, to soothe eruptions caused by
heat, with the happiest results. Care must be
taken not to let the wash get into the eyes, as
it certainly will smart, though it may not be
strong enough to do further harm. No more
purifying, healing lotion is known to medical
skill, and its work is speedy. Poor baby was
not beautiful with his face of unaccustomed
spots and blotches, when the laving with the
fluid began at night, but next morning they
were hardly visible. I commend this again to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>mothers as a specific against those irritations
with which children suffer. For soothing musquito
bites alone it is worth all the camphor,
soda washes, and hartshorn that ever were
tried.</p>

<p>There is a word of comfort to-day for those
most hopeless cases of unloveliness, tow-colored
blondes. Light hair of the faintest shade,
without a tinge of gold or auburn, is now fancied
abroad. Chignons of pale hair, dressed
in abundant frizzes, command nearly as high
a price as those pure <i>blondes dorées</i> which
have been worth so many times their weight
in gold. Ladies of fashion in France dye their
hair, or rather bleach it, to this colorless state;
and the effect is very piquant with dark eyes
and complexion. At the fêtes in Paris recently
a marchioness of daring taste attracted general
admiration by her pale tresses, relieved by
profuse black velvet trimmings. Indeed, the
only wear for <i>très blondes</i> is black, even if it
is only black alpaca, with transparent ruches at
the neck and wrists. Let such not fear to expose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>themselves to the fiercest sun to gain a
shade or two of color in the face. If the fine-grained
skin which accompanies such hair take
on a pale, even brown, so much the better for
artistic effect. Dark eyes will give brilliancy to
the dullest face; and dark they must be, if the
harmless crayon can make them so by skillful
shading about the light lashes. If ever art is
a boon, it is when called in to change the sickly
whiteness of too blonde brows and lashes.
We can hardly expect that girls will carry
their zeal for coloring so far as to feed for
months on the meal from sorghum seed, which
has the powerful effect of deepening the tint
of the entire flesh—a phenomenon as true as
strange; but we must hope that they will live
and work in the rays of that great beautifier,
the sun, which brings out and perfects all undeveloped
tones in Nature’s painting. Pale
eyes darken in exercise out-of-doors, and pasty
skins grow prismatic like mother-of-pearl, in
that wonderful way which fascinated Monsieur
Taine when he beheld the miraculous brows
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>and shoulders of English ladies. The idea did
not seem to suggest itself to the critical Frenchman,
but it will to every woman, that these
charms were not wholly due to Nature. It
is bewildering to read the announcements of
toilet preparations under seductive names—rosaline,
blanc de perle, rose-leaf powder, magnolia,
velvetine, <i>eau romaine d’or</i>, and the rest.
Think of the potent chemistry which waits
outside our windows untried! Among the list
of “eyebrow pencils,” “nail polishes,” and lip
salves, a foreign paper brings to notice one invention
which might be of use—a nose-machine,
which, we are told, so directs the soft
cartilage that an ill-formed nose is quickly
shaped to perfection. No surgeon will deny
that this is possible to a great degree. That it
would be a boon nobody can doubt, seeing
how many unfortunates walk the world whose
noses have every appearance of having been
sat upon, or made acquainted with the nether
millstone. Long thimbles reaching to the second
joint for shaping fingers are a new device,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>though something of the kind was used by
very particular beauties fifty years ago. The
only thing women would not do to increase
their comeliness is to put themselves on the
rack, unless indeed it were to live healthily.</p>

<p>A correspondent wishes to know what will
remove superfluous hair, adding that she is annoyed
with such a growth of it on her face
that she is the remark of her friends. These
unfortunate cases are the result of morbid constitution,
freaks of nature which are to be combated
as one would eradicate leprosy or scrofula.
The extreme growth of hair where it
should not be comes from gross living, or is
inherited by young persons from those whose
blood was made of too rich materials. Living
for two or three generations on overlarded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>meats, plenty of pastry, salt meats, ham, and
fish, with good old pickles from brine—in
short, what would be called high living among
middle-class people—is pretty sure to leave its
marks on lip and brow. Sometimes typhoid
fever steps in and arrests the degeneration by
a painful and searching process, which, as it
were, burns out the vile particles, and, if the
patient’s strength endure, leaves her almost
with a new body. The red, scaly skin peels
off, and leaves a soft, fresh cuticle, pink as a
child’s; the dry hair comes out, and a fine,
often curling suit succeeds it, while moles and
feminine mustaches disappear and leave no
sign. But this fortunate end is not secured
to order, and there are preferable ways of renewing
the habit of body.</p>

<p>For immediate removal of the afflicting shadows
which mar a feminine face there are many
methods. The Romans used tweezers, regularly
as we do nail-brushes, to pull out stray
hairs; and Lola Montez speaks of seeing victims
of a modern day sitting for hours before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>the mirror painfully pulling out the hairs on
their faces. But this often makes the matter
worse; for if the hairs are broken off, and not
pulled up by the roots they are sure to grow
coarser than before. Often one hair pulled
out sends two or three to grow in its place.
A paste of fine wood-ashes left to dry on the
skin is said to eat off hairs, and is probably as
safe as any remedy. The authority on feminine
matters quoted above recommends very
highly a plaster which pulls the hairs out by
the roots. Spread equal parts of galbanum
and pitch plaster on a piece of thin leather,
and apply to the place desired; let it remain
three minutes, and pull off suddenly, when it
brings the hairs with it, and they are said not
to grow again. This will probably bring the
tears into the eyes of any one who tries it;
but the courage of damsels desiring a smooth
face is not to be damped by such trifles as an
instant’s pain. If the plaster were left on
more than three minutes, it would be apt to
bring the skin with it in coming off. It is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>better to use daily a paste of ashes or caustic
soda, left on as long as it can be borne, washing
with vinegar to take out the alkali, and
rubbing on sweet-oil to soften the skin, which
is left very hard by these applications. Applied
day after day, it would not fail to kill
the hair in a month, when it would dry and
rub off. This may be used on the arms, which
might be whitened and cleared of hair together
by bathing them in a hot solution of chloride
of lime as strong as that used for bleaching
cotton, say two table-spoonfuls to a quart of
water. Bathe the arms daily in this, as hot as
can be borne, for not over two minutes, washing
afterward in vinegar and water, and rubbing
with almond or olive-oil. This should be
done in a warm room before an open window
to avoid breathing the fumes of the chloride,
which are both unpleasant and noxious. Strong
soft-soap left to dry on the arms would in time
eat away any hair. But the trouble is that
these strong agents eat away the skin almost
as soon as they do the hair, and nice care must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>be used to prevent dangerous results. If the
blood should be in bad order, though not suspected
by any one, least of all by the person
interested, caustic of any sort might eat a hole
in the flesh that would fester, and be a long
time healing. I saw a frightful sore that a
lady made on her neck, trying to remove a
mole with lunar caustic, and should advise every
one to be careful how they run such painful
risks. It is not wise to endure pain heroically,
thinking to have the matter over and
done with at once. Better try the applications
many times, leaving them to do their work
gradually and surely.</p>

<p>To lay the foundation of true beauty, the
system should be purified within as well as
without. Nothing is of so much value in this
respect as the vapor-bath. In all our large
cities public establishments exist for taking
these baths, and their virtues are well appreciated
by those who once try them. At the
largest bathing-houses in New York ladies
attend regularly for the sole object of improving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>their complexion. Perhaps the most
successful form administered is the sulphur
vapor-bath, which works wonders for neuralgia.
It purifies and searches the blood, and I
have seen a patient who had lost one of the
loveliest complexions in the world, as she
thought forever, come out of her bath day
after day visibly whitened at each trial. For
ladies past youth nothing restores such softness
and child-like freshness to the cheek or
such suppleness to the figure. Of course these
baths can only be taken at places for the purpose,
where chemical means are not wanting.
I only mention them to urge all ladies who
have the chance of trying them not to fail of
doing so, both for pleasure and benefit.</p>

<p>The vapor-bath, pure and simple, has stood
for some time among household remedies for
various ills, and is given by seating the undressed
patient on a straw or flag chair over a
saucer in which is a little lighted alcohol, and
wrapping chair, patient, and all in large blankets.
After a few minutes the perspiration
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>streams as if he were in a caldron of steam,
and may be kept up any length of time. Fifteen
minutes are enough. A tepid bath should
follow, if one is not chilled by it, and after
that either a good sleep or exercise enough
to keep one in a glow. Impurities are discharged
from the system in this way which
else might occasion fever. The hair, skin,
and nails are insensibly renewed and refined
by it. There is not the least danger of taking
cold if the precautions are taken of rubbing
dry, dressing quickly and warmly, and keeping
the blood at its proper heat by work or
fire—in short, by doing just those things
which ought to be done should one never go
near a vapor-bath.</p>

<p>Arabian women have a similar method of
perfuming their bodies by sitting over coals
on which are cast handfuls of myrrh and spices.
The heat opens the pores, which receive the
fumes, till the skin is impregnated with the
odor, and the women come out smelling like a
censer of incense. Twice a week is often
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>enough for the vapor-bath; as for the fumigation,
some creature doubtless will be wild
enough to try the experiment once, which will
be sufficient for a lifetime. <i>If she do</i>, she will
be very glad to know that ammonia bathing
will destroy most traces of her adventurous
caprice.</p>

<p>A profusion of hair, however, is a sign of
nature’s liberality, and this growth is found in
connection with a strength and generosity of
constitution that is capable of the best things
when duly refined. South Americans, with
their supple bodies overflowing with vitality,
have splendid tresses, and so have the Spaniards
and Italians. Such people are quick and
lasting in the dance, own deep tuneful voices,
move with vigor and ease, and have a luxuriance
of blood and spirits, which is too
precious to restrain or lose. Fasting, denial
of pleasant food and plenty of it, till one is
worn to an anchorite, may do for religious
penance, but does not reach physical ends so
well as moderate and satisfying indulgence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>If any poor girl think, from reading this paper,
that she ought to starve and waste herself
by sweating because she has a pair of mustaches
and a coat of hair on her arms, she is
vastly mistaken. If she want to know what
she may eat, let her study Professor Blot’s
cookery-book. Whatever is there she may eat,
<i>as</i> it is there, assured that all the delightful
French seasoning will not do her blood half
the injury of a season’s course of pies made
after good Yankee fashion—the crust half
lard and half old butter, the filling strong
with spice or drenched with essence, as the
case may be.</p>

<p>If ever a woman deserved a seat in the
French Academy for the value of her literary
labors to her kind, it was Madame Celnart.</p>

<p>The works of this lively author on manners,
dress, cosmetics, and kindred topics no
less interesting to her sex, are found in eight
small octavos in their native French. The
lady was an industrious and brilliant writer
on themes of the toilet, the household, and
deportment, on which Mrs. Farrar, author of
<i>The Young Lady’s Friend</i>, of our mothers’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>time, and Mrs. Beeton, the editor of <i>The Englishwoman’s
Magazine</i>, in our day, have succeeded
her with much adornment but hardly
equal scope. Madame Celnart talks—one can
hardly imagine her holding a pen—like a Parisian,
with empressement, with drollery, precision,
and inimitable sprightliness. Her lectures
sound like those of a gentle old beauty,
secure in the charm of her finished manner
against the loss of her earlier fascinations, telling
the secrets of her age to a younger generation,
with half a smile at their readiness to
seize these arts, and seriously pointing out the
most graceful or the most modest way of doing
things, with the concern of one who is conscious
that grace and prudence do not come
to all her sex by nature. Imagine the arch
gentleness with which she opens her work on
the toilet in such easy, sparkling guise as this:</p>

<p>“<i>Je viens de feuilleter les arts de plaire, les
livres de beauté, et autres évangiles des courtisane</i>,”
which may be freely translated, “I come
to speak of the arts of pleasing, the literature
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>of beauty, and other evangels of coquetry.”
She has a well-bred curl of disdain for “<i>une
allure bourgeoise mesquine</i>;” but with the reverence
of a true Frenchwoman, whose creed is
her mirror, she pronounces her work “<i>consacré
à la toilette, et la conversation de la beauté</i>.”
These duties she divides with serious precision
into the “<i>soins de la toilette</i>,” which include
cosmetic arts, and “<i>l’art de se coiffer, lacer, et
chausser</i>.” It was indeed an art, in the time
of hundred-boned corsets without clasps, to
lace one’s self, and in the days of classic sandals
to put on one’s shoes. She is as exact in
all her details as a school-mistress, though one
fancies a covert smile on her wise face as she
rallies the young demoiselles who dreaded the
bath—because it was so cold? Oh no; but
because their modesty could not endure the
baring of their person even to themselves.
Such, she gravely advises, may save their “<i>pudeur</i>”
by bathing in a peignoir. One inevitably
recalls Lola Montez’s dedication of her
famous <i>Book of Beauty</i>, “To all men and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>women who are not afraid of themselves,” on
encountering these French demoiselles with
their conventual susceptibility.</p>

<p>The graceful preceptress goes on with directions
for sitting, for holding one’s needle,
for dancing, and holding one’s petticoats out
of the mud. Nobody will allow that these
hints are superfluous who notices the varied
awkwardness which women fall into who are
habitually thoughtless on these points. Some
of these nice customs may have been carried
to our shores, possibly with Rochambeau’s
French ladies at Newport or Salem. I remember
hearing one of the fine Newburyport
ladies, who answer to the description of gentlewomen
still, maintain earnestly that it was
most graceful to “sew with a long point”—that
is, to push the needle nearly its whole
length through at each stitch, instead of pulling
it out, so to speak, by the nose. And she
was right, as you can verify by the next sewing
you take up.</p>

<p>In the time of Madame Celnart, fine ladies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>used to powder their hair with the dust of
Florentine iris, which gave their love-breathing
tresses the violet odor of spring. A pleasant
idea; but their iris, our orris-root, must
have been a trifle fresher than comes to this
country. It makes us sure that the beauties
of Titian’s and Guido’s times were real women,
to know that they steeped their tresses in
bleaching liquids and dyes, and spread their
locks in the sun for hours to gain the coveted
golden tinge; and the hair of the Bella
Donna herself might have caught part of its
enchantment from the sprinkling of violet
powder that lent its waves a soul. Those immortal
beauties would have canonized Lubin
had he been alive with his pomades and perfumes
in their time. Celnart was a courageous
advocate of cosmetics, or else she was
wise enough to put the worst first, for one of
her earliest recipes is this depilatory, which is
not at all quoted by way of recommendation.
It is the Oriental Rusma, a depilatory used
in harems:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>
<p>Two ounces of quicklime, half an ounce of
orpiment and red arsenic; boil in one pint of
alkaline lye, and try with a feather to see
when it is strong enough. Touch the parts
to be rid of hair, and wash with cold water.
When we say that orpiment and realgar are
deadly poisons, and add Madame Celnart’s remark
that the mixture is of “<i>une grande causticité</i>,”
often attacking the tissue of the skin,
our readers will quite agree with her that it is
only to be used with “<i>la plus grande circonspection</i>,”
or, still better, not at all. The
<i>Crème Parisienne depilatoire</i> is harmless, and
is given for what it is worth: One eighth of
an ounce of rye starch, and the same of sulphate
of baryta (or heavy-spar), the juice of
purslane, acacia, and milk-thistle, mixed with
oil.</p>

<p>The high-sounding Paste of Venus, devised
by a Parisian cosmetic artist, who shared the
mythologic fancy which prevailed years ago,
was spread over the skin to soften and perfume
it. Esther herself might have used it,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>for its conjugation of spices would delight an
Oriental. It was made of fat, butter, honey,
and aromatics—the more the better; but as
none of our belles wish to try the anointing
bodily, I spare them the list, and give instead
the <i>Esprit de pyrêtre</i>. The pyrethrum, or
Spanish pellitory, is an herb highly valued by
cosmetic artists, and appears in several recipes
of the French:</p>

<p>Powdered cinnamon, one drachm; coriander,
nineteen scruples; vanilla, the same; clove,
eighteen grains; cochineal, mace, and saffron,
the same; simple spirit of pyrethrum, one litre
(about seven eighths of a quart). Let these
ingredients digest for fifteen days, and add
orange-flower water, half an ounce; oil of anise,
eighteen drops; citron, ditto; oils of lavender
and thyme, each nine drops; ambergris,
three grains. Mix the ambergris with the
pyrêtre, and put the two liquids together. Filter
after two days. Use as a toilet water.</p>

<p>No wonder French cosmetics are so highly
valued, when their composition embraces
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>such a variety of pleasing ingredients. Thyme,
anise, and saffron seem homely herbs for a
woman’s use, but they assisted at every toilet
among the Greek women of old; and Rhodora
wove the crocus (meadow-saffron) with the
rose, and fennel among her jasmines, without
a thought such as these things give us of sick-teas
and home-made dyes. Why should herbs
of such excellent renown lose the poetry that
belongs to them? Mingled in variety with
ambergris and orange flowers, they give body
to a perfume rich enough to have satisfied
Cleopatra.</p>

<p>If this recipe is complicated, what will be
said to the next, compounded by South American
women, and fashionable in Paris not so
very long after the time of Josephine, who
may have patronized, or, indeed, introduced
this souvenir of creole coquetry. Madame
Celnart says of it, “Only the Tartuffes of
coquetry could blame the Mexican pomade,”
whose proportions indicate that the formula
came straight from the perfumer’s hands, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>is therefore correct. Any one who wishes to
try it can reduce the measure to suit herself:</p>

<p>Extract of cocoa, sixty-four ounces; oil of
noisette, thirty-two ounces; oil of ben, thirty-two
ounces; oil of vanilla, two ounces; white
balsam of Peru, one drachm; benzoin flowers,
half a drachm; civet, ditto; neroli, one drachm;
essence of rose, one drachm; oil of clove flowers,
one ounce; citron and bergamot waters,
each half a pint. Steep the vanilla in the cocoa
butter eight days in a hot place; dissolve
the balsam in half a glass of alcohol, with the
benzoin and civet, and add the spirit of clove.
Mix the essence of rose and neroli in the oils
of ben and noisette, and beat the whole forcibly
together in a large marble or china bowl.</p>

<p>Creole women spread this paste on their
smooth skins, which the oil of cocoa softens
and moistens, while the delightful changing
odor is absorbed, till their forms are like living,
dusky, but perfumed marbles. These recipes
are given not so much for imitation, or
to contribute to the lore of perfumers this side
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>the water, as curiosities of national arts and
feminine vanity. Where in our country would
we find the ingredients of the celebrated <i>Eau
de Stahl</i>, known to the Parisian chemists forty
years ago? Its compound was as follows:</p>

<p>Alcohol, nine litres; rose-water, three litres;
the root of Spanish pellitory, five ounces; gallingale
root, three ounces; tormentil, three
ounces; balsam of Peru, three ounces; cinnamon,
five drachms; rue, one ounce; ratania,
eight ounces. Powder the whole, and put in
alcohol; shake well, and leave to macerate six
days. Pour off, and let it stand twenty-four
hours to clear, after which add essential oil of
mint, one and a half drachms; powdered cochineal,
four drachms. Leave to infuse anew
three days; filter through filtering-paper, and
decant. Use for a tooth-wash, for washing
the face, or for baths.</p>

<p>Peruvian powder was a standard dentifrice
of the same date. It is made of white sugar,
half a drachm; cream of tartar, one drachm;
magnesia, ditto; cinnamon, six grains; mace,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>two grains; sulphate of quinine, three grains;
carmine, five grains. Powder and mix carefully,
adding four drops of the oils of rose and
mint.</p>

<p>The following cosmetic, called the <i>Serkis du
Sérail</i>, is said to be a favorite lotion used by
the Sultanas, for whom it is imported from
Achaia—though this sounds more like one
of those pleasant fictions which perfumers delight
to invent concerning their oils and pomades
than any thing we are obliged to believe.
This may be said in favor of the assertion—it
is such a mixture of starch and oils
as no one but an odalisque could endure to
use. It is made of sweet-almond paste, ten
livres; rye and potato starch, each six livres;
oil of jasmine, eight ounces; the same of oil of
orange flowers and of roses; black balsam of
Peru, six ounces; essence of rose and of cinnamon,
each sixty grains. Mix the powders
and essences separately in earthen vessels, then
add the powder to the liquid little by little,
bruise well together, and strain through muslin.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>
<p>An elegant preparation for whitening the
face and neck is made of terebinth of Mecca,
three grains; oil of sweet almonds, four ounces;
spermaceti, two drachms; flour of zinc, one
drachm; white wax, two drachms; rose-water,
six drachms. Mix in a water-bath, and melt
together. The harmless mineral white is fixed
in the pomade, or what we would call cold
cream, and is applied with the greatest ease
and effect. It must be to some preparation
of this subtle sort that the lustrous whiteness
of certain much-admired fashionable complexions
is due. It is a cheap enamel, without the
supposed necessity of <i>baking</i>, which, by the
way, is such a blunder that I wonder people
of sense persist in speaking of it as if it could
be a fact.</p>

<p>For any woman, maid or matron, past youth,
who hears the leaves begin to drop, and sees
the roses curl in the warm summer of her life,
this chapter is written. It is well that with
the decay of bloom and outward charm there
should be a lessening of feeling, an amiable
indifference to the homage that youth covets
eagerly. The woman of—who dares fill in
the age?—the woman who finds the faint
lines on her cheek and the pallor creeping to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>her lip should have learned and tasted many
things in her life—so many that she can appraise
the value of all, and resign them contentedly,
with a little sigh, not for what they
were, but for what they were not.</p>

<p>She should have loved, and, if possible, have
won love in return, though that is less matter.
The wisdom, the blessedness, come through
loving, not through being loved.</p>

<p>It is well if she can accept the complement
of her affection, and find out of what mutable
elements it is made: its fervor and forgetfulness;
its devotion, often eclipsed and as often
surprising with its fresh strength—weak where
we trust it most, and standing proof where we
surely expect it to fail.</p>

<p>Such is the love of man. It is a riddle,
whose learning has cost gray hairs on tender
temples, the roses from many cheeks.</p>

<p>It is the tradition that love makes or mars
a woman’s life; but I have yet to learn that it
does not exert an equal though silent power
over the lot of men. Be that as it may, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>woman in love is far more beautiful than one
out of it. And this is true if the love last to
threescore.</p>

<p>Let women, if they would remain charming,
by all means keep their hold on love, their
faith in romance. The power of feeling gives
vitality and interest to faces long after their
first flush has passed. Speaking as matter of
fact, this is the case, for emotion has a livelier
power than the sun has over the blood, and
the miracle of love in making a plain girl
pretty is explained by the stimulating effects
of happiness on the circulation. If you would
preserve inspiration in your looks, beware how
you repress emotion. Cultivate, not the signs
of it, but emotion itself, for the two things are
very distinct. Suffer yourself to be touched
and swayed by noble music and passion. To
do this, place yourself often under the best influences
within reach. There may be pathos
enough in the rendering of a poor little girl’s
song at the piano to stir tenderly chords of
feeling that were growing dull for want of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>use. The rose of morning, the perfume of
spring, have rapt many a middle-aged woman
away to divine regions of fancy, from which
she came back with their dewy freshness and
smell lingering about her. Youth has its daylong
reveries while its hands are at work. We
older ones need to reserve with jealous care
our hours of solitude, in which the springs fill
up.</p>

<p>The faces of old beauties have no charm beyond
that of feeling. Look at the women
who were reputed the belles of our large
cities twenty years ago. They may be well
preserved; but in most cases they are mere
masks in discolored wax. The pearly teeth,
the small Grecian features, the soft, fine hair
and regular eyes are left, but the brow has
learned neither to weep nor smile, the lips are
composed, and might be mute for all the expression
that replaces their lost crimson. One
could adore the wasted beauty of the Duchess
of Devonshire, “worn by the agitations of a
brilliant and romantic life,” for the sake of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>the fire and kindness that lit even its death-pillow;
and the Josephine of Malmaison, with
eyes always eloquent of tears, wins more devotion
than the empress at Saint Cloud, confessed
the loveliest woman of France. Let no woman
fall into the mistake of preserving her
beauty by refraining from emotion, for all she
can keep by such costly pains will be the coffin-like
shapeliness of flowers preserved in sand.</p>

<p>Laugh, weep, rejoice, or suffer as life provides.
Only feel something natural, worthy
and vivid enough not to leave your face a
blank.</p>

<p>There is a time between twenty-five and
thirty-five when the struggle of life, mean or
lofty as it may be, oppresses women sorely.
Fret and care write crossing script on their
faces, which grow yellow and pinched till they
despair of comeliness. This is when they are
learning to live. Ten years or so make the
lesson easy, and it is one of the thankfulest
things in the world to see such faces going
back to the blossom and sunny sweetness of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>their spring. Many a woman is handsomer at
thirty-nine than she was at thirty. Nature responds
wonderfully to the reliefs afforded her.
The only counsel is to let Nature go free.
Do not think, because trial has bent spirit and
frame together, that they should stay so a moment
after the heavy hand is off. If you feel
like singing, sing, not humming low, but joyful
and clear as the larks, that would carol
just as gayly at ninety, if larks lived so long,
as the first summer they left their nests. The
worst of English and American systems of
manners is the constant repression they demand.
It impairs even the physical powers,
so that in training a singer the first thing
great artists do is to teach her to feel, in
order, as they say, to “warm up” the voice
and give it fullness. Women need to cultivate
pleasure and amusement far more after
they are thirty than before it, I mean romantic
pleasures, such as come from exquisite colors
and sceneries in nature or their homes,
from poetry and the loveliest music. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>are twice as impressible then as they are in
youth, if they know how to get hold of the
right notes. They leave themselves to fall out
of tune, and forget to respond.</p>

<p>Yet, as a woman does not love to carry her
thinned tresses and crow’s-feet into the glare
of the opera, or to talk poetry when rheumatism
twinges her middle finger, the craft of
the toilet comes in most gratefully. The
freshness of the skin is prolonged by a simple
secret, the tepid bath in which bran is stirred,
followed by long friction, till the flesh fairly
shines. This keeps the blood at the surface,
and has its effect in warding off wrinkles.
Bohemian countesses over thirty may go to
arsenic springs, as they were wont to do, for
the benefit of their complexions; but the home
bath-room is more efficacious than even the
minute doses of quicksilver with which the
ladies of George the First’s court used to
poison themselves—a primitive way of getting
at the virtues of blue-pill.</p>

<p>The celebrated Madame Vestris slept with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>her face covered by a paste which gave firmness
to a loose skin and prevented wrinkles.
It was a recipe which the Spanish ladies are
fond of using, which requires the whites of
four eggs boiled in rose-water, to which is
added half an ounce of alum, and as much
oil of sweet almonds, the whole beaten to a
paste.</p>

<p>A favorite cosmetic of the time of Charles
II. was the milk of roses, said to give a fair
and youthful appearance to faded cheeks. It
was made by boiling gum-benzoin in the spirits
of wine till it formed a rich tincture, fifteen
drops of which in a glass of water made a fragrant
milk, in which the face and arms were
bathed, leaving the lotion to dry on. It obliterates
wrinkles as far as any thing can besides
enamel.</p>

<p>To restore suppleness to the joints, the
Oriental practice may be revived of anointing
the body with oil. The best sweet-oil or oil
of almonds is used for this purpose, slightly
perfumed with attar of roses or oil of violets.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>The joints of the knees, shoulders, and fingers
are to be oiled daily, and the ointment well
rubbed into the skin, till it leaves no gloss.
The muscles of the back feel a sensible relief
from this treatment, especially when strained
with work or with carrying children. The
anointing should follow the bath, when the
two are taken together. It is a pity this custom
has ever fallen into disuse among our
people, who need it quite as much as the sensuous
Orientals.</p>

<p>Opera-dancers in Europe use an ointment
which is thus given by Lola Montez: The
fat of deer or stag, eight ounces; olive-oil,
six ounces; virgin wax, three ounces; white
brandy, half a pint; musk, one grain; rose-water,
four ounces. The fat, oil, and wax are
melted together, and the rose-water stirred into
the brandy, after which all are beaten together.
It is used to give suppleness to the limbs in
dancing, and relieves the stiffness ensuing on
violent exercise. Ambergris would suit modern
taste better than musk in preparing this.</p>

<p>Among the recipes, more or less valuable,
which come to light in old collections, one for
the toothache, by Boerhaave, is too useful to be
lost. Even beauties have the toothache sometimes,
especially after going home from the
Academy of Music on a snowy night with a
tulle scarf folded about their heads, or after
sitting with their backs to the window in a
half-warmed parlor during a ceremonious call.
Use before beauty, mademoiselles; and with
no more excuse is proffered the <i>Esprit Odontalgique</i>,
which should be kept in the dressing-room,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>ready for the slightest signs of that most
terrible malady, from which nobody dies.</p>

<p>Alcohol of thirty-three degrees, one ounce;
camphor, four grains; opium in powder, twenty
grains; oil of cloves, eighty drops. The efficacy
of this lotion will be seen at a glance,
and no other authority for its use is needed
than that of the learned and excellent physician
who gave it its name.</p>

<p>Very properly follow the gray pastilles for
purifying the breath. They do so, not by disguising
it, but by reaching the root of the difficulty,
arresting decay in the teeth, and neutralizing
acidity of the stomach. The mixture
is very simple: Chlorate of lime, seven
drachms; vanilla sugar, three drachms; gum-arabic,
five drachms—to be mixed with warm
water to a stiff paste, rolled, and cut into lozenges.</p>

<p>Madame Celnart archly advises all good
wives to let their spouses know that these lozenges
entirely remove the traces of tobacco in
the breath. As a good wife will hardly interfere
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>with a favorite habit of her husband who
is fond of smoking, the least any gentleman
can do is to render his presence acceptable
after the indulgence.</p>

<p>Another pastille, preferable on some accounts
to the above, but owing its value to the
same principle, is made from chlorate of sodium,
twenty-four grains; powdered sugar,
one ounce; gum-adraganth, twenty grains;
perfumer’s essential oil, two drachms. Powder
the chlorate in a glass mortar; put the
powder in a cup, and pour in a little water;
let it settle, and pour off. Repeat the process
three times with fresh water, filtering what is
poured off each time, and mix the gum and
sugar with it, adding the perfume last.</p>

<p>A gargle for the mouth which combines
all the virtues of <i>Eau Angelique</i>, and every
other wash of heavenly name, is made of the
chlorate of lime in powder, three drachms;
distilled water, two ounces. Reduce the chlorate
with a glass pestle in a glass mortar, add
a third of the water, stir, and pour off, as directed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>before, till all is added. To this add
two ounces of alcohol, in which is dissolved
four drops of the volatile oil of roses and four
drops of perfumer’s essential oil. Half a teaspoonful
of the solution in a wine-glass of water
is to be used at a time as a tooth-wash and
gargle for the mouth and gums.</p>

<p>With the best intentions as to physical neatness,
many persons are unable to make the impression
of their company wholly agreeable.
They may remember with advantage that
rinsing the mouth with this fluid six times a
day is not too much pains in order to make
themselves acceptable to others. There is no
surer passport to esteem than an innocent,
taintless person, which wins upon one before
moral virtues have time to make their way.
If you think this truth is repeated too often,
study the impression made by the respectable
people you meet for the next month. The result
will satisfy you that those who are as neat
as white cats are as one to fifteen of the careless,
easily satisfied sort.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>
<p>Slight disorders of the system make themselves
known by the sickly odor of the perspiration,
quite sensible to others, though the person
most interested is the last to become conscious
of it. The least care, even in cold
weather, for those who would make their physical
as sure as their moral purity, is to bathe
with hot water and soap twice a week from
head to foot. Carbolic toilet soap is the best
for common use, as it heals and removes all
roughness and “breakings out” not of the
gravest sort. Ladies whose rough complexions
were a continual mortification have found
them entirely cleared by the use of this soap.
The slight unpleasant odor of the acid present
soon disappears after washing, and it may be
overcome by using a few spoonfuls of perfume
in the water.</p>

<p>An excellent preparation for bathing is
Bacheville’s <i>Eau des Odalisques</i>. The French
recommend it highly for frictions, lotions, and
baths. It is made in quantity for free use after
this recipe: Two pints of alcohol, one of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>rose-water, half a drachm of Mexican cochineal,
four ounces of soluble cream of tartar, five
drachms of liquid balsam of Peru, five drachms
of dry balsam of the same; vanilla, one drachm;
pellitory root, one and a half ounces; storax,
one and a half ounces; galanga, one ounce;
root of galanga, one and a half ounces; dried
orange peel, two drachms; cinnamon, essence
of mint, root of Bohemian angelica, and dill
seed, each one drachm. Infuse eight days, and
filter. For lotions, add one spoonful of this to
six of water. It is also useful for freshening
the mouth, adding twenty-four drops of it to
four teaspoonfuls of tepid water. For diseased
gums, double the dose, and gargle with
it several times a day.</p>

<p>The <i>Pâte Axérasive</i> of Bazin, the celebrated
perfumer, has the distinction of being highly
commended by the French Royal Academy
of Medicine. It is better for toilet use than
soaps which contain so much alkali. Take
powder of bitter almonds, eight ounces; oil
of the same, twelve ounces; <i>savon vert</i> of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>the perfumers, eight ounces; spermaceti, four
ounces; soap powder, four ounces; cinnabar,
two drachms; essence of rose, one drachm.
Melt the soap and spermaceti with the oil in
a water-bath, add the powder, and mix the
whole in a marble mortar. It forms a kind
of paste, which softens and whitens the skin
better than any soap known.</p>

<p>Make toilet waters and pastes of this kind in
quantity, as they improve with age. It costs
about one fourth as much to prepare them
as to buy the same quantity at the perfumer’s,
and one has the advantage of a finer article.
Do not use cheap soap for the toilet. Such
is almost always made of rancid or half-putrid
fat, combined with strong alkalies, which dry
and crack the skin, sometimes causing dangerous
sores by the poisonous matter they introduce
from vile grease. <i>Never</i> allow such
soap to touch the flesh of an infant. To do
so is little better than absolute cruelty. White
soaps are the safest, as they are only made of
purified fat.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>
<p>The feet should be washed every night and
morning as regularly as the hands. It preserves
their strength and elasticity, and helps
to keep their shape. What person of refinement
can take any pleasure in looking at her
own feet presenting the common appearance
of distortion by shoes <i>too tight in the wrong
place</i>, and the dry, hardened skin of partial
neglect? One’s foot is as proper an object
of pride and complacency as a shapely hand.
But where in a thousand would a sculptor find
one that was a pleasure to contemplate, like
that of the Princess Pauline Bonaparte, whose
lovely foot was modeled in marble for the delight
of all the world who have seen it?</p>

<p>As nice care should be given to feet as to
hands, beginning with a bath of fifteen minutes
in hot soap and water, followed by scraping
with an ivory knife, and rubbing with a
ball of sand-stone, which will be found most
useful for a dozen toilet purposes. The nails
may be left to take care of themselves, with
constant bathing and well-fitting shoes, unless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>they have begun to grow into the flesh,
when all to be done is to scrape a groove
lengthwise in each corner of the nail. The
whole foot should be anointed with purified
olive-oil or oil of sweet almonds after such a
bath. A pair of stockings should be drawn on
at night to preserve the bedclothes from grease-spots.
The oil will soak off the old skin, and
wear away the scaly tissue about the nails,
while it renders the soles as soft and pliant
as those of a young child.</p>

<p>A daily change of stockings is as desirable
for those who walk out as a fresh handkerchief
every morning—but how many people
consider it necessary? It may sound audacious
to suggest that when laundry-work is an
item, a lady would show her ingrain refinement
by washing her own Balbriggan hose as
truly as by stinting herself to two pair a week
on account of washer-women’s bills. As for
the vulgarity of wearing colored stockings
“because they show dirt less,” it is to be repudiated,
save in the case of children, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>are quite capable of going through with a
box of white stockings in a day, and looking
none the cleaner for it at the end. Our bootmakers
are in fault about the lining of shoes,
which ought to be changeable when soiled.
Soiled, indeed! When are common shoes ever
clean within? Our manufacturers are the opposite
of the French, whose workmen wear
fresh linen aprons, and wash their hands every
hour, for fear of soiling the white kid linings
at which they sew. The time will come when
we will find it as shocking to our ideas to wear
out a pair of boots without putting in new lining
as we think the habits of George the First’s
time, when maids of honor went without washing
their faces for a week, and people wore
out their linen without the aid of a laundress.
Cleanliness means health in every case, and a
plea must be offered for those neglected members,
that only find favor in our eyes by making
themselves as diminutive as possible.</p>

<p>How lusty and delicate the young leaves
grow on their stems in their nook of sunshine!
What could be lovelier in its way than the
three geranium leaves starting from the mould
in the window-box where the sun strikes across
the corner of the sill? They are so firmly
poised, yet glancing; each full of green juice
that the sun turns to jewel-light, with spots of
darker tint where the feathered edges overlie—a
subtle piece of color wrought by sun and
soil for no eye to see but by chance, yet ecstatic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>in its delight, as if meant for the centre trefoil
of an altar window. So the sun does all his
work. So leaves grow by myriads in the garden
and the forest. So the forces of nature
bring forth every thing perfect if left free to
their impulses.</p>

<p>There is something like the leaves in our
frames, that would grow springy and strong,
soft-colored and brilliant, upright and joyous,
if it were suffered to. It appeals for sunshine
and gayety, for abundant food and ease,
for copious watering, tendance, and freedom.
Give it these, and the body, under present
conditions, is as far beyond its common dullness
and weakness as it is below the saints in
light; for heavenly bodies can not be very different
from ours unless they cease to be bodies.</p>

<p>The mortal frame is noble enough as it is.
No harp ever vibrates like it with emotion
and pleasure; no star shines so fair or so wise
as the face of man. God made it, and God
loves it, which is the reason it wins so closely
upon us, and is so dear. There is no wisdom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>in despising the body or its sensations. It is
crudity to uphold that the mental part of us
should absorb all the rest. Brain and heart
are dependent on the body, and it was meant,
not for the slave—as men seem never weary
of preaching—but for the interpreter and
companion of both.</p>

<p>Honor is due the body, and thanks for its
pleasures, which should be enjoyed with intelligence
and leisure. They are no more
low or debasing than mental pursuits may be
when pursued to the exclusion of all others.
The sensualist is no more intolerable in the
order of nature than the pedant or pretender
in literature, and does little more harm in the
long-run. The former ruins himself; the latter,
by a false philosophy, may lead thousands
astray. Give the body its due—its thirds with
the mind and the soul. Neither is the better
for having more than its share.</p>

<p>The need of physical culture grows more
and more urgent in this country. Here most
unlike races mix sullen and mercurial blood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>together in the most variable of climates.
They interchange habits as well, though the
only one peculiar to Americans as such is a
tolerable contempt for the conditions of health—a
contempt inherited through half a dozen
generations. The climate is not in fault, but
the people are. It is much easier in this
country to be magnificent than to be clean.
At any hotel there is enough of useless upholstery,
as a matter of course, but a bath is
an extra, often not to be had on any terms.
This is the case even in the metropolis, where
at least a better idea of civilization ought to
prevail. For the rest, there is not much to be
said for the intelligent culture of any family
who have carpets before their bath-room is
fitted up.</p>

<p>When refinement has reached a step beyond
faucets and water-pipes, each house will have
its distilling apparatus to provide the purest
water for drinking and bathing. Nobody will
any more think of drinking undistilled water
than they do now of eating brown sugar when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>they can get white. Her Majesty the Queen
of England uses nothing but distilled water
for her toilet, and the luxury and softness of
such a bath are so great that no one used to
its indulgence will consent to forego it. A
small still costs five dollars, and would provide
all the water that is needed for family
use. It should be kept in action all the time,
and fill a close reservoir for bathing, while that
for cooking and drinking should be freshly
distilled each day. A simple substitute for a
still is a tea-kettle, with a close cover and a
gutta-percha or lead pipe fastened to the
spout, leading through a pail of cold water
into a jar for holding the distilled water. The
steam from the boiling water goes off through
the tube, condenses under the cold water,
and runs off pure into the receiver. Where
houses are heated by steam, I am told, they
may be amply provided with distilled water
by adding a pipe to one of the tubular heaters,
that will carry steam into a cooler, from
which pure water may run day and night.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>
<p>Besides the distilled-water baths in a complete
household, there should be facilities for
the vapor-bath at any time. This is invaluable
in colds, rheumatism, congestions, and neuralgia.
The readiest substitute is the rush-bottomed
chair and lighted saucer of alcohol
described in a former chapter. A sulphur
bath requires a shallow pan of coals with a
tin water-pan above it, and an elevated seat
over the whole. Sulphur is thrown on the
coals, which mingles with the steam, and enters
the system by the pores, which are opened
by the vapor. The patient, brazier, and chair
must be enveloped with a water-proof covering
in the closest manner, leaving only the
head exposed, so that no sulphurous vapor can
possibly be breathed, as that would be suffocation
at once. In regular bathing establishments
the patient sits in a wooden box,
having a cover and a water-proof collar which
fits tight about the neck, leaving the head out.
This box is filled with steam by a pipe, and
the vapor impregnated with sulphur from a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>spoonful burning in one corner of the box,
or from a generator outside with connecting
tube. It is difficult, if not impossible, to administer
a sulphur bath without proper and
special appliances.</p>

<p>The bran bath, recommended before, is taken
with a peck of common bran, such as is used
to stuff pincushions, stirred into a tub of warm
water. The rubbing of the scaly particles of
the bran cleanses the skin, while the gluten in
it softens and strengthens the tissues. Oatmeal
is even better, as it contains a small
amount of oil that is good for the skin. For
susceptible persons, the tepid bran bath is better
than a cold shower-bath. The friction of
the loose bran calls the circulation to the surface.
In France the bran is tied in a bag for
the bath, but this gives only the benefit of the
gluten, not that of the irritation.</p>

<p>The frequency of the bath should be determined,
after it has been taken for a week or
two, by feeling. Take the refreshment as often
as the system desires it. The harm is done
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>not so much by bathing often as by staying in
the water long at a time. A hot soap-suds
bath once a week is beneficial to persons with
moist and oily skins. Bay-rum and camphor
may be used to advantage by such persons
each time after washing the face. The hot
suds bath should be taken thrice a week by
those who wish to remove moth patches.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to make the hands
soft and white is to wear at night large mittens
of cloth filled with wet bran or oatmeal,
and tied closely at the wrist. A lady who
had the finest, softest hands in the county
confessed that she had a great deal of house-work
to do, but kept them white by wearing
bran mittens every night.</p>

<p>Pastes and poultices for the face owe most
of their efficacy to the moisture, which dissolves
the old coarse skin, and the protection
they afford from the air, which allows the
new skin to form tender and delicate. Oat
meal paste is efficacious as any thing, though
less agreeable than the pastes made with white
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>of egg, alum, and rose-water. The alum astringes
the flesh, making it firm, while the egg
keeps it sufficiently soft, and the rose-water
perfumes the mixture.</p>

<p>What are called indiscriminately moth,
mask, morphew, and, by physicians, hepatic
spots, are the sign of deep-seated disease of
the liver. Taraxacum, the extract of dandelion
root, is the standing remedy for this,
and the usual prescription is a large pill four
nights in a week, sometimes for months. To
this may be added the free use of tomatoes,
figs, mustard-seed, and all seedy fruits and
vegetables, with light broiled meats, and no
bread but that of coarse flour. Pastry, puddings
of most sorts, and fried food of all kinds
must be dispensed with by persons having a
tendency to this disease. It may take six
weeks, or even months, to make any visible
impression on either the health or the moth
patches, but success will come at last. One
third of a teaspoonful of chlorate of soda in
a wine-glass of water, taken in three doses,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>before meals, will aid the recovery by neutralizing
morbid matters in the stomach. There
is no sure cosmetic that will reach the moth
patches. Such treatment as described, such
exercise as is tempting in itself, and gay society,
will restore one to conditions of health
in which the extinction of these blotches is
certain.</p>

</div>


<p>Request is often made for the details of
Mr. Banting’s system of reducing flesh. The
popular idea of the writer, whose modest pamphlet
has linked his name with the system he
observed, is very like the caricature of the
dry modern savant. The severe scientist who
keeps his child for years without fire or clothes
to demonstrate the superiority of human beings
to cold, or who throws a new-born baby
into a tub of water to prove that the race can
swim by nature, should not be mentioned on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>the same page with the kindly enthusiast of
the letter on corpulency.</p>

<p>There is no evidence in its pages that the
writer ever tried authorship before. He was
over sixty-six years old, when, in a burst of
gratitude for his relief from the burden of too
much flesh, he took up his pen to tell his fellow-creatures
of help for those who suffer a
like infliction. The quaintness of his pages
reminds one of Izaak Walton, from his opening
sentences, where he declares, “Of all the
parasites that affect humanity, I do not know
of, nor can I imagine, any more distressing
than that of obesity”—an opinion with which
all his fellow-sufferers will agree. He is fond
of terming his grievance a parasite, and the
name slips out with a frequency which is like
the echo of objurgations hurled at his infirmity.
Being called to account for it later, he
meekly declares that the word is used wholly
in a figurative sense. His state might have
justified a stronger epithet. No parents on
either side, to use his own phrase, ever showed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>a tendency to corpulency, but between thirty
and forty he found the habit growing upon
him. His physician advised violent exercise,
and he took to rowing. Finding his flesh increase,
he consulted “high orthodox authority
(never any inferior adviser), tried sea air and
bathing, took gallons of physic and liquor potassæ,
always by advice, rode horseback, drank
the waters of Leamington, Cheltenham, and
Harrowgate”—doses enough, we should think,
to have disgusted him with life forever—“lived
on sixpence a day, and earned it, at
least by hard labor, and used vapor-baths
and shampooing,” without any help for his infirmity.</p>

<p>The rich gentleman found his position, the
good things of this life, his houses, horses, and
friends, small enjoyment, save as they lessened
the increasing burden life heaped upon him.
He was obedient and intelligent in using every
means of relief suggested, but his doctors were
of very small use to him. As he pathetically
says, “When a corpulent man eats, drinks, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>sleeps well, has no pain and no organic disease,
the judgment of able men seems paralyzed.”
His state was pitiable, and there are
too many companions in distress who answer
to the same picture. He could not tie his
shoe, and often had to go down stairs slowly
backward, to save the jar of increased weight
on his ankles and knee-joints. Low living was
prescribed, and he followed it so heartily that
he brought his system into a low, irritable
state, and broke out in boils and large carbuncles,
for which he had to be treated and
“toned up” in a way that brought him into
heavier condition than ever.</p>

<p>He speaks feelingly, yet with simple dignity,
of the trials which stout people endure, being
crowded in cars and stages, uncomfortable in
warm theatres and lecture-rooms, besides finding
themselves the butt of ridicule, or, at least,
the object of remark. The last caused him
for many years to give up public pleasures.
Many persons, as they read, will have cause to
reproach themselves, for those who are considerate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>of every other species of human infirmity
fail to recognize the real suffering of
those who carry a load of flesh. A sensitive
person encumbered with adipose feels keenly
the glances, if not the smiles, which follow his
entrance into a public vehicle. It is a test of
delicacy for others to appear unconscious of
his infirmity.</p>

<p>When Turkish baths came into fashion, Mr.
Banting tried them, with the result of six
pounds’ loss after taking fifty baths, which was
not encouraging, though they have been of
service in other like instances. In August,
1862, his case stood thus: He was nearly sixty-six
years old, five feet five inches high, and
weighed over two hundred pounds. He went
to no excess in eating or drinking, his diet
being chiefly bread, beer, milk, vegetables,
and pastry. Flesh impeded his breathing, his
eye-sight failed, and he lost his hearing, yet
most of the doctors he went to for relief considered
his trouble of no account, as one of the
accompaniments of age, like wrinkles and gray
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>hairs. The faculty are to blame for overlooking
such a foe to human comfort.</p>

<p>Mr. William Harvey, Surgeon of the Royal
Dispensary for Diseases of the Ear, was the
first person wise and considerate enough to
prescribe a remedy. He reasoned from M.
Bernard’s accepted theory of the product of
glucose as well as bile from the liver. Glucose
is allied to starch and saccharine matter,
and is produced in the liver by ingestion
of sugar and starch. The substance is always
present in excess both in diabetes and obesity,
and it struck this eminent surgeon that the
same dry diet which drains the excess of glucose
in the former disease might be of service
in the latter. Abstinence from food containing
starch and sugar reduces diabetes, and accordingly
he prescribed it for his patient. He
was to leave off all bread, milk, butter, beer,
sugar, and potatoes, besides other root vegetables,
as these contain the largest amount of fat
material.</p>

<p>Yet the diet allowed was liberal. Breakfast
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>was four or five ounces of beef, mutton, kidney,
broiled fish, and any cold meat except
veal and pork; a large cup of tea without milk
or sugar, a little biscuit—<i>i. e.</i>, crackers—or an
ounce of dry toast.</p>

<p>Dinner: five or six ounces of any fish except
salmon, herring, and eels, which are too
fat; any vegetables but potatoes, beets, parsnips,
carrots, or turnips, green vegetables being
especially good; an ounce of dry toast;
the fruit of a pudding; any poultry or game;
two or three glasses of good claret, sherry, or
Madeira, but no champagne, port, or beer.</p>

<p>Tea: two or three ounces of fruit, a rusk or
two, and a cup of tea without milk or sugar.
Supper, at nine: three or four ounces of meat
or fish, and a glass of claret. Before going to
bed, if desired, a nightcap of grog without sugar
was allowed, or a glass of claret or sherry.</p>

<p>This was comfortable compared to his former
diet, which was bread and milk for breakfast,
or a pint of tea, with plenty of milk and
sugar, and buttered toast; dinner of meat,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>beer, bread, of which he ate a great deal,
and pastry, of which he was fond, with fruit
tart and bread and meat for supper. Yet on
the liberal diet his flesh went down at the rate
of more than a pound a week for thirty-five
weeks.</p>

<p>He explains his belief that certain food is
as bad for elderly people as beans are for
horses, and thenceforth he calls the forbidden
food “human beans.” He suffers himself to
make a little mirth over the enemy that held
him in durance so long. We can well believe
he would “scrupulously avoid those <i>beans</i>,
such as milk, beer, sugar, and potatoes,” after
he had groaned a score of years from “that
dreadful tormenting parasite on health and
comfort.” He sensibly writes his opinion that
“corpulence must naturally press with undue
violence upon the bodily viscera, driving one
part on another, and stopping the free action
of all.” He calls Mr. Harvey’s system “the
tram-road for obesity,” and says, “The great
charm and comfort of this system is that its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>effects are palpable within one week of
trial.”</p>

<p>He protests that he found not the slightest
inconvenience in the probational remedy,
which reduced his girth twelve inches and his
weight thirty-eight pounds in thirty-five weeks.
He could go up and down stairs naturally, and
perform every necessary office for himself
without the slightest trouble; his sight was
restored, and his hearing unimpaired. In token
of his gratitude, he gave the doctor, besides
his fees, the sum of £50, to be distributed
among the hospital patients. To prove
the reality of his dedication of his letter “to
the public simply and entirely from an earnest
desire to benefit his fellow-creatures,” the
editions were distributed gratuitously in hopes
of reaching his fellow-sufferers from flesh. He
was eager that they should find the relief which
to him was rapturous. It must have reached
some cases, for more than 58,000 copies had
been issued at the date of this edition. The
author was urged to sell his work, even if the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>proceeds were given to the poor; but with the
sensitiveness of a man not used to appear in
public, he says, “On reflection, I feared my
motives might be mistaken.” In giving the
credit of this system to Dr. Harvey, we are
sure of obeying the wishes of the author, who
speaks of his benefactor with extreme gratitude,
and says, “He has since been told it is a
remedy as old as the hills, but the application is
of recent date.” He thinks any one who suffers
from obesity may “prudently mount guard
over the enemy, if he is not a fool to himself.”
He was so far delivered from his malady as
to indulge in the forbidden articles of food;
but says, “I have to keep careful watch, so
that if I choose to spend a day or two with
Dives, I must not forget to devote the next to
Lazarus.”</p>

<p>No medicine was given with this diet save
a volatile alkali draught in the morning during
the first month. This was probably the
bromide of ammonia, which is of great use in
reducing an over-amount of flesh.</p>

<p>Among inquiries not seldom repeated is an
urgent demand for a prescription to keep the
hair from coming out. The following letter
will be acceptable to many readers.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was emphatically one of the ‘ugly girls,’ being of a
very large figure, and inheriting thin hair; otherwise I suited
myself well enough. But oh! the agonies I have suffered
through my personal deficiencies. Now, with a happy home
of my own and the best husband in the world, I can smile
at the old distress. Yet it was no less real, and I can pity
the ugly girls as nobody but one who has ‘been there’ can.</p>

<p>“My hair began coming out when I was just in my teens,
and has always been the trial of my life. I have been up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>and down the whole scale of restoratives, with all manner
of recipes volunteered by sympathizing friends. Last fall,
after returning from a two months’ stay near Saratoga, where
I had undergone a severe course of treatment for sundry physical
ills, my hair came out frightfully, till I was almost without
any, and nothing seemed to check it. A relative, an old
lady, told me to use burdock-root tea. I tried it, and it
worked like a charm. My hair has never grown as it does
now, and it has absolutely ceased coming out—something
that has not been the case for fifteen years. Something of
this may be due, as far as growth is concerned, to a receipt
given me by a friend a month or so ago. It is a family receipt,
and something of a family secret. The ladies of the
house, who use it, have magnificent hair, which they attribute
to this receipt. It is a queer conglomerate, as you see:
One pound of yellow-dock root, boiled in five pints of water
till reduced to one pint; strain, and add an ounce of pulverized
borax, half an ounce of coarse salt, three ounces of sweet-oil,
a pint of New England rum, and the juice of three large
red onions, perfumed at pleasure—(a quarter of an ounce of
oil of lavender and ten grains of ambergris would be efficacious
in overcoming the powerful scent of the ingredients).</p>

<p>“My little girl has magnificent hair, but it troubles me
by coming out this winter. As she is only five years old,
I have hesitated about putting any thing on. I wish you
would some time say if it is best to doctor a child’s hair, or
let nature take its course. I have learned that to shampoo
the head with cold water every morning is an excellent thing,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>as is an occasional thorough washing with soap-suds, not rinsing
the soap out completely. I have sometimes checked the
fall of hair by such means. The burdock root was also used
by steeping it in boiling water till a strong tea was made
and used as a wash two or three times a day, then at longer
intervals.”</p>
</div>

<p>In answer to the query in the excellent letter
above, it may be said that it is always well
to cure where there is disease. Simple remedies
aid nature. A child’s hair is too valuable
to lose. One teaspoonful of ammonia to
a pint of warm water makes a wash that may
be used on a child’s head daily with safety.
It does not split the hair, as soap will do if
left to dry in.</p>

<p>One of the most powerful stimulants and
restoratives for the hair is the oil of mace.
Those who want something to bring hair in
again are advised to try it in preference to
cantharides, which it is said to equal, if not to
surpass, without the danger of the latter. A
strong tincture for the hair is made by adding
half an ounce of the oil of mace to a
pint of deodorized alcohol. Pour a spoonful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>or two into a saucer; dip a small, stiff brush
into it, and brush the hair smartly, rubbing
the tincture well into the roots. On bald
spots, if hair will start at all, it may be stimulated
by friction with a piece of flannel till
the skin looks red, and rubbing the tincture
into the scalp. This process must be repeated
three times a day for weeks. When the hair
begins to grow, apply the tincture once a day
till the growth is well established, bathing the
head in cold water every morning, and briskly
brushing it to bring the blood to the surface.</p>

<p>When the hair loses color, it may be restored
by bathing the head in a weak solution
of ammonia, an even teaspoonful of carbonate
of ammonia to a quart of water, washing the
head with a crash mitten, and brushing the
hair thoroughly while wet. Bathing the head
in a strong solution of rock-salt is said to restore
gray hair in some cases. Pour boiling
water on rock-salt in the proportion of two
heaping table-spoonfuls to a quart of water,
and let it stand till cold before using.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>
<p>The old specific of bear’s grease for the hair
is hardly found now, and one can never be
sure of getting the real article; but an equally
powerful application is discovered in pure
sperm-oil, of the very freshest, finest quality.
This forms the basis of successful hair restoratives,
and will not fail of effect if used alone.
It is, however, procured in proper freshness
only by special importation from the north
coast of Europe.</p>

<p>In the list of hair-dyes, one agent has long
been overlooked which is found in the humblest
households. It is too common and humble,
indeed, to excite confidence at first; but
it is said that the water in which potatoes
have been boiled with the skins on forms a
speedy and harmless dye for the hair and eyebrows.
The parings of potatoes before cooking
may be boiled by themselves, and the water
strained off for use. To apply it, the
shoulders should be covered with cloths to
protect the dress, and a fine comb dipped in
the water drawn through the hair, wetting it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>at each stroke, till the head is thoroughly
soaked. Let the hair dry thoroughly before
putting it up. If the result is not satisfactory
the first time, repeat the wetting with a sponge,
taking care not to discolor the skin of the
brow and neck. Exposing the hair to the sun
out-of-doors will darken and set this dye. No
hesitation need be felt about trying this, for
potato-water is a safe article used in the
household pharmacopœia in a variety of ways.
It relieves chilblains if the feet are soaked in
it while the water is hot, and is said to ease
rheumatic gout.</p>

<p>Inquiries have been made after a cure for
corns. It is not always the case that they
come from wearing tight shoes. I have seen
troublesome ones produced by wearing a loose
cloth shoe that rubbed the sides of the foot.
It is best always to wear a snugly fitting shoe
of light, soft leather, not so tight as to be painful,
nor loose enough to allow the foot to
spread. The muscles are grateful for a certain
amount of compression, which helps them
to do their work.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>
<p>When corns are troublesome, make a shield
of buckskin leather an inch or two across, with
a hole cut in the centre the size of the corn;
touch the exposed spot with pyroligneous acid,
which will eat it away in a few applications.
Besides this, a strong mixture of carbolic acid
and glycerine is good—say one half as much
acid as glycerine. Of course, only a very
small quantity will be needed, and it must be
kept out of the way, for it is a burning poison.
In default of these, turpentine may be used
both for corns and bunions. A weaker solution
of carbolic acid will heal soft corns between
the toes.</p>

<p>A Southern lady sends the following recipe
for glycerine lotion, which is refined and pleasant
as well as useful. The pain of sunburned
and freckled skin, so troublesome to many of
our fair readers, can be relieved, and the shining
morning face of youth restored, by this application:
Take one ounce of sweet almonds,
or of pistachio-nuts, half a pint of elder or
rose-water, and one ounce of pure glycerine;
grate the nuts, put the powder in a little bag
of linen, and squeeze it for several minutes in
the rose-water; then add glycerine and a little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>perfume. It may be used by wetting the face
with it two or three times a day. This is a
grateful application for a parched, rough skin.
It should be allowed to dry thoroughly, when,
if it feel sticky or pasty, it may be washed off
with warm water.</p>

<p>The reason why so many young women
have rough faces is, they wash their faces every
day but neglect to cleanse their bodies.
The pores are clogged by secretions, and
morbid matters in the blood break out in the
only free spot, the face. The ladies of King
George’s court were perfectly logical when
they refused to wash their faces lest it should
spoil their complexions. They seldom washed
either bodies or linen, and it was dangerous to
give their festering blood an outlet by clearing
a place for it.</p>

<p>Full-blooded girls whose complexions give
them trouble should not eat fat meat save in
the depth of winter, nor drink milk. They
may take these in after-years, if they grow thin
and weak from hard work or the nursing of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>children. Their systems can turn the grapes
and pears they ought to feed on, the fish,
chicken, and lean meat, the nutty oatmeal and
wheat cakes (not mushes), into flesh enough to
round their elbows, and strength enough to
make their walk like the figure of a dance.
They should try daily bathing, or rather scrubbing
with soap and hot water, followed by a
cold dip, a process taking a matter of ten minutes
a day, at most, if they know the meaning
of dispatch. Very likely they will need a few
bottles of Saratoga water or doses of salts to
clear the blood, adhering religiously to a Graham
diet the while, or their last state after the
medicine will be worse than the first. After
taking the sulphur vapor-baths they must go
out-of-doors, and finish bleaching themselves
in the sun. By living in it five hours a day,
they may gain the lovely painted marble of
the English girl’s face, who reaps all day in
the harvest field.</p>

<p>Cosmetics sometimes play tricks with fair
skins which are quite mysterious to the unlucky
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>subject. This is the case with the tar
and olive ointment named a few chapters ago.
Those who find that its application brings out
a fearful crop of pimples, and turns the skin
yellow, should feel that the ointment has been
a friend to them, in detecting a state of the
blood that is any thing but safe. People of
sedentary habits, who pay little attention to
their health, are not aware how vitiated their
blood may be for want of sunshine, good food,
and exercise. Its torpid current leaves no
mark of disease on the surface; humors concentrate
in the vital organs, and finally appear
in the form of chronic disorders. Consumption
leaves the skin clear and brilliant, because
the morbid matters which usually pass off
through the skin are eating away the life in
ulcers beneath. The tar brings them to the
surface, and one application sometimes leaves
a face in a sorry state. Three ladies of different
families tried the recipe at the same
time, with frightful results, for the reason that
they were all in the state when a dose of blood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>purifier would have had the same effect. One
lady kept on using the lotion, and her face
became smooth after trying it three or four
times. When people perspire freely, such unhappy
effects are seldom noticed. Apropos of
this, come a few lines from W. H. H. Murray,
the author of the <i>Hand-book of the Adirondacks</i>.
A lady who was puzzled by the effect
of the cosmetic wrote to him about it, knowing
he was familiar with its use in the mountains,
and received this merry answer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have had a hearty laugh over your perplexity. All
I know is, the mixture was common sailors’ tar and sweet-oil,
with the consistency of sirup. Our party, ladies and
gentlemen both, have used it freely for years in the woods,
and the ladies have always declared that it made their skin
as soft as satin. Certain it is, it never caused any <i>rash</i> in
their case.”</p>
</div>

<p>Delicate, fair-skinned women are the very
ones on whom this cosmetic will have the
effect of drawing humors to the surface.
Heavens! how many of this sort there are in
the world—pale, shadowy as porcelain, fragile
of bone and tender of skin, about as useful as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>wish-bones of a Christmas chicken! They have
intense souls; it is a pity they have not enough
body to hold them. Is there not wit enough
in the world to conjure flesh to the bones and
strength to the muscles of this great army of
weak women?</p>

<p>It is not a little amusing to receive requests
for a way to give sulphur vapor-baths to the
face alone. Somebody wants a fair complexion,
and fancies it may be gained by bleaching
the face like an old Leghorn bonnet in a barrel.
Aside from the certainty of being choked
to death by this method, there is no way of
whitening and refining the face by applications
to it alone, when the conditions of health
are not regarded in other things. Carbolic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>acid may heal pimples, and glycerine masks
soften the skin; but lovely red and white,
with lips like currants, and skin like the flesh
of young cranberries, can not be had unless
the blood is pure. For this it is indispensable
that food should be regulated, plenty of exercise
and sunshine taken, and all the bodily
functions kept in the best order.</p>

<p>The woman who thought she could take
the sulphur vapor-bath at home in her own
bath-room finds that her experience reads like
a chapter from the Danbury <i>News</i> man. A
bouquet of burning matches would furnish
the perfume inhaled in the process, and the
vapor reaching her face, left it pale and
brown in spots, as if she had moth patches.
That she escaped with hair only partially
tinged, and any eyebrows to speak of, is due
to Nature’s guardian care, which prompted the
struggle for life half a minute sooner than
pride was inclined to give up. The fumes
lingering about the premises have induced the
gravest suspicions on the part of her neighbors.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>She is inclined to think that, if her face
would only turn brown again all over, she
would forego her dreams of Parian brow and
cheeks like peaches.</p>

<p>A sulphur vapor-bath is a matter of caution,
when given by the best of hands. It is not
well to take it in the damp, “breaking-up”
weather of March, for the bath opens the
pores, and catching cold with several grains
of sulphur in one’s body is the next thing to
salivation by mercury. The consequence is
that one feels heavy and aching, the eyes
grow weak, and teeth grumble, while latent
rheumatic pains wake up to sharp reminder
of one’s imprudence. When the weather is
warm and settled, these baths are a luxury
and medicine combined. They are most effectual
purifiers of the system, searching out
and removing all waste particles, to leave the
skin as new and fair as a baby’s. I have seen
old and darkened complexions restored by
them in a way that was little short of miraculous.
These baths are also of benefit in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>neuralgia, and deal powerfully with scrofulous
affections.</p>

<p>The time is not far distant when every town
that owns a public hall will also have its public
baths. Before that time comes, physicians
ought to moderate the charges for these remedial
agents. Outside of our large cities, the
cost of taking sulphur vapor-baths is $5 each,
and they are given only in series, as prescribed
by the judgment or humor of the
physician. When will people learn the laws
and habits of their own bodies, so that they
need not be at the mercy of every specialist
who chooses to make money out of their emergencies?
For the benefit of outsiders it ought
to be said that the charge in the best establishments
of New York is not higher than $2 50
for the single bath, and a great reduction from
this is common.</p>

<p>The essential difficulty of the sulphur vapor
treatment is to keep from the face the powerful
fumes, which are dangerous to breathe. For
this object the bather enters a wooden box,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>with a cover that fits the neck. She takes a
seat in the box undressed, and the cover is
adjusted so that only the head is left out.
Cloths or a rubber collar are closely drawn
about the neck to prevent the least escape of
gas, and a wet sponge is laid on the top of
the head, or, what is better, a very wet towel
folded turbanwise round the back of it, and
over the top, thus cooling the base of the
brain, the side arteries, and sensitive upper
part. This compress must be frequently wet
with cold water during the bath—a precaution
which removes the danger of apoplectic seizures
by the intense heating of the blood.
Steam charged with sulphur is then let into
the box by pipes, and in three minutes the
perspiration flows as if the luckless victim
were melting away. In the best establishments
an attendant fans the bather all the
time the steam is let on, to cool the head,
into which the heated blood rushes in a way
that makes the wet towel smoke directly.
And this is an attention the patient must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>insist upon, for faintness or apoplexy may be
the alternative.</p>

<p>In the sultry and oppressive weather of
summer the hot bath is of all others most
cooling. No matter how heated the system,
water as hot as possible is the safest and most
efficient relief. One wants to remain in it
long enough to give every part of the body a
thorough scrubbing with soap and a mohair
wash-cloth, which cleanses the skin more thoroughly
than a brush. The hot water dissolves
every particle of matter that clogs the
pores, the rough cloth and soap remove it
searchingly, and the towel is hardly laid aside
before a delicious coolness and freshness passes
upon one, like that of a dewy summer morning.
The dangers resulting from a sudden
check of perspiration by plunging into cold
water when overheated, or by sitting in a
draught to cool, are avoided, and a greater
sense of coolness follows. People who suffer
much in warm weather should reckon this a
daily solace. All enervating effects are warded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>off by an instant’s plunge into cool water of,
say, seventy degrees. I say cool, for it certainly
will feel as if iced after a bath of nearly
a hundred and fifty degrees. In a common
bath-room, by this means, one may experience
much of the real benefit of a Russian vapor-bath.</p>

<p>The bath lasts fifteen minutes, when the
vapor is turned off. When the steam in the
box has had time to condense, the cover is unjointed,
and the bather treated to a scrubbing
with soap and warm water, which gradually
cools and cleanses the body. Then cooler water
is poured over the body, and, after wiping,
one is wrapped in a fresh sheet and lies down
to pleasant dreams.</p>

<p>It is hard that such a necessary requisite
to the highest vigor should rank, as it does,
among luxuries. One can hardly imagine an
addition to a fine house more desirable than
a bathing-hall, such as Roman patricians added
to their palaces, where any form of vapor
or hot bath was at command.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>
<p>Many improvements are needed in our public
baths. There should be small dressing-closets,
as there are at swimming-baths, where
one’s clothes may be kept from contact with
beds on which a thousand people rest in the
course of a year. The reposing-hall should be
well lighted, and paved with tiles, instead of
being spread with bits of carpet to be tossed
about; and there should be ample space between
the couches. Every thing should convey
the impression of space and repose—of
sunshine, for the sake of its reviving power,
and of refinement, for the soothing it always
brings the nerves.</p>

<p>Usually the bath-house is built in a court-yard,
where high walls on every side shut out
the sunlight. The basement dressing-room is
filled with narrow couches covered with light
rubber sheets, suggestive of nothing more pleasant
than cast-off clothing, and rest measured
by the bath clock, when one’s pillow must be
given up to a new-comer.</p>

<p>From this huddled room the bather steps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>into one beyond summer heat, dark and dripping
with moisture, with a plunge bath in
the centre. Passing through it, one finds
next what seems like a wide marble staircase
running the length of each side almost to
the low roof, with gratings let in the face of
the steps. The bather ascends one of these
stony couches, and lies down with head on the
stony pillow carved every six feet or so for
the purpose. Wrapped in a sheet, already wet
with moisture since leaving the dressing-room,
a large sponge dipped in cold water at the
back of one’s head, and another at the mouth
and nose, one feels as if there were perspiration
enough already for sanitary purposes;
but when, with a hiss and a roar, the steam is
let on through the gratings, one finds the difference.
Rolling vapor fills the room, so dense
that every outline is shut out as completely as
in the darkest night. The heat rises to suffocation,
the new bather thinks, and rushes again
and again to the douche against the wall to
wet her throbbing head, or into the next room,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>which seems cool as a waterfall, for a gasp of
air that she can breathe. Old and experienced
bathers lie still, declaring that, with head down
and the wet sponge pressed to the nose, they
breathe without difficulty. What was perspiration
is literally a flowing away in rills and
sheets of water that drip from the bather’s
reeking sides. One seems to have turned to
jelly, and submits helplessly to the scrubbing-brush
and final shower-bath of water at eighty
degrees, which causes a shiver by contrast.</p>

<p>The outer room is refreshing in its coolness,
and one wraps a dry sheet and blanket round
one and lies down on the India-rubber cloth
in dreamy indifference to all the rest of the
world.</p>

<p>What follows is Elysium. Every ache and
pain, every care, is dispelled in a trance of rest.</p>

<p>All the descriptions by Eastern travelers
of the luxury of the bath are found true in
this last stage of enjoyment. One is rejuvenated,
entranced, and sinks into a light sleep,
whose approach seems a prelude to paradise.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>The eyes close to keep out the sordid surroundings
of the bathing-room; and every
idea, or rather sensation—for the brain is too
passive to think—is bliss. This is the <i>dolce
far niente</i> Italians aspire to—the sum of all
delight possible to sensation. Passion and
rapture have no charms that equal it. It is
the death and extinction of all pain. Quite
as beautiful is the return to consciousness,
sense after sense regaining double brightness
as softly and steadily as the unfolding of a
flower.</p>

<p>After a reluctant waking and going out into
the sunlight again one seems to have found a
new self. The feather-like lightness and elasticity
of every limb amount almost to delirium,
they are so different from one’s usual dullness.
It is freedom that feels like flying. If this is
simply health, in our common state we must
be farther toward extinction than we imagine.</p>

<p>In this state of purity and light one learns
to reverence one’s physical self. A body that
at its best is so glorious and happy ought not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>to be exposed to the disturbance of appetite
and the contact of gross things. We need to
be very much more refined in our living, eating,
and breathing. We ought to be nicer
about our clothes and our food, choosing the
best of meats, and fruit far better than we are
now content with, and should place our dwellings
out of the reach of the least impure air. In
this altered and steadied frame evil dispositions
lose their sway. Irritable temper is soothed,
despondency flees as by magic, and fiercer passions
lie asleep as at the stroking of their
manes. If any one should read this page who
battles with unnatural desires, which make life
less blessed and lofty than it was meant to be,
let her have recourse to this efficient ally. It
will restore one from the horrible depression
which craves alcohol or opium, it will rescue
from the perilous excitement of overwrought
nerves or too much brain-work, and
banish those morbid feelings which consciously
or unconsciously incline to impurity of imagination
if not of life. The purity of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>body and the soul are too closely interwoven
for any one to dare neglect them.</p>

<p>In the old time, saints used to subdue the
body by prayer and fasting. The modern
way is by prayer and bathing.</p>

<p>It is hard enough to keep a peaceable,
firm, and sweet habit of soul without letting
loose on it the humors and insanities of the
body. These are in no way so surely quelled
as by warm baths, and this is why they ought
to be among the public buildings of every
village, and made as cheap as possible. There
the drunkard might find a stimulus which
has no reaction, the emotionally insane a sedative
that would clear his brain and steady his
nerves. There the exhausted watcher by the
sick might recruit, and the overwrought student,
lawyer, or physician find support without
recourse to perilous stimulants. The doors of
such a place in a large city should stand open
night and day, like those of churches.</p>

<p>Women need the bath for all these purposes
even more than men. The feeble mother
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>will find no soothing for her jarred nerves or
lightener of her burdens like the well-applied
bath. Strange as it sounds, the vapor-bath
does not weaken. It washes away the worse
particles of the body that weigh it down, and
leaves it as if winged. I have known an invalid
of years take it twice and thrice a week,
gaining strength every time. If harm came, it
is because the head was not kept cool by fanning,
or because the final sponging was not
gradual enough. There is harm in every
remedy used unskillfully. It is the doctor’s
province to direct in such matters, always premising
that the best and wisest physicians prefer
to teach their clients the rules of health
and treatment for themselves, and seldom refuse
to give the reason and theory of their
orders. It is safe to be shy of the perceptions
and methods of a doctor who doesn’t like to
tell what medicines he gives, and why he gives
them. The keenest and best medical men are
impatient to have others see and understand
the truth as well as themselves.</p>

<p>Did you ever go to see a lady, not of uncertain
but of uneasy age, and find yourself
ushered into the family sitting-room by a new
servant, who did not know the ways of the
house? Did you find her with a court-plaster
lozenge an inch wide between her eyes, and
one at the outer ends of her eyebrows? At
sight of this remarkable ornament, did concern
express itself lest she had fallen down
stairs, or had a difference with the cat? Were
these insinuations parried with veteran resources,
and were you dissuaded from further
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>inquiry by the delicate remark that she could
interest you better than by giving the history
of her scratches? Of course you knew there
was a mystery about those bits of court-plaster,
and perhaps feel so to this day, unless Nature
have given you the mind of a detective. If
so, your patience is to be rewarded. The
secret of those patches was not scratches, but
wrinkles.</p>

<p>I trust due tribute will be paid to the ingenuity
of failing age, which has perfected this
device for warding off its unwelcome tokens.
The rationale of the plan is very simple. The
plaster contracts the skin, and prevents its
sinking into creases and lines. It also protects
and softens the skin. I have heard of
one oldish lady who wears these ornamental
appendages all the time in the house when not
receiving company, and covers parts of her
face with a dough made of well-mumbled
bread to keep her complexion fair. The heroism
of this resistance to time must be applauded,
but it is an open question whether
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>the play is worth the candle. The beauty of
age lies not in freshness like that of sixteen,
but in clear and lofty expression, in the look of
experience and not unkindly shrewdness, in the
finish of self-repression, of calmness, trust, and
sympathy. These things grow on a face as it
loses freshness and roundness, just as the sky
begins to show through thinning boughs.</p>

<p>The greatest of blessings for some people
would be to learn to accept themselves and
their gifts. If they could stand apart from
themselves a while to see their becoming
points, much of their repining would be dropped.
Every thing and every body is beautiful
in its season. There is a wholesome plainness
that accords with domestic life and natural
surroundings, as the bark of trees relieves their
green. The color of health, the gentleness
and sweetness that come of a conquered self,
are elements of beauty that make any face
tolerable. How dear are the plain faces that
have watched our childhood, with whom we
have grown up so closely that feature and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>form have lost their significance, so that we
really do not know whether they are homely
or not, and see only the love or the humor
that lives in their faces. In general, very
ugly people are happily indifferent to their
looks, and degrees of imperfection may always
be lessened by judicious use of the arts
of dress.</p>

<p>A young and homely woman makes herself
agreeable by the complete neatness of
a very simple toilet. Let her eschew dresses
of two colors, or of two shades even, though
the latter are allowable, if the shadings are
very soft. When the complexion is dull, there
must be some warm or lively tinges of color
in the costume, and vice versa. But it is easier
to dress real figures than to generalize.</p>

<p>Cornelia Jackson is the rector’s daughter,
and hasn’t above $200 a year to spend on her
clothes and to buy Christmas presents. She
is a little too plump, is brown, with some
warm color in her cheeks in summer, and has
dark hair. Her face never would be noticed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>except for the jollity lurking in it, which she
inherits from her father. In winter and fall,
when she looks pale, she “tones up” with a
morning dress of all-wool stuff, one of those
brown grounds with small bunches of brilliant
crimson or purple flowers—a cheery pattern
that the rector likes behind the coffee
urn of a cold morning—with crisp white
ruffles, set off by the brown dress. Crimson
or purple, in soft brilliant shades, are her
colors for neck-ties. Her street dress is a
dark walnut-brown cloth, trimmed with cross-cut
velvet the same shade. The over-skirts of
Cornelia’s dresses are always long, so that she
will not look like a fishing-bob or a doll pin-cushion;
and there is deep rose-color about
her bonnet. Not roses, by the way—she has
an unspoken feeling that it is not for every
body to wear roses—but velvety mallows and
double stocks, imitations of fragrant common
garden flowers that are very like herself. The
brown and crimson maiden is a pleasant sight
of a winter’s day, when the gray of the church
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>and white of the snow need something warm
to come between them. In summer she chooses,
or her cousin in New York chooses for her, not
the light percales that every one else is wearing,
nor the grays and stone-colors that walk to
church every Sunday, but écru linens, with relief
of black or brown for morning, when she
goes from pantry to garden, and from sewing-machine
to nursery. Afternoons she doesn’t
divide herself by putting on a white blouse
and colored skirt, or a buff redingote over a
black train, but wears a dress of one color,
that looks as if it were meant to stay at home.
White nansook is her delight, its semi-transparency
wonderfully suiting her clear brownness,
but solid white linen or cambric she eschews.
Soft violet jaconet, and the whole
family of lilacs, are made for her; and she is
luxurious in ruffles and flounces on her demi-trained
skirts, since she makes and often irons
them herself. Black grenadine, of course, she
wears, with high lining to give her waist its
full length, every bit of which it needs; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>she is not too utilitarian to neglect the aid
which a modest demi-train on a house dress
gives to her height. All the other girls may
wear puffed waists and pleated waists. She
knows they are not for her plump shoulders,
though clusters of fine tucks on a blouse give
length to the waist, and lessen the width of
the back. Shawls she never wears, nor short
perky basques, that are considered—I don’t
know why—the proper thing for stout figures.
Her choice is the long polonaise, and
the French jacket, which by its short shoulders
and simple lines conveys a decent comeliness
of figure to any one who wears it. If she had
a party dress, it would be white muslin, or
light silvery green silk, trimmed with pleatings
of tulle, and with them she would wear
her mother’s pearls, or her own fine carbuncles.</p>

<p>Mrs. Senator, with all her fortune and position,
is doomed to hear people speak of her in
under-tones at parties, “She is rich, but very
plain.” Being a shrewd woman, she does not
waste her efforts on trying to alter her thin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>features, nor does she make herself ridiculous
by a false complexion of rouge and pearl-powder,
though her face and her hair are about of
a brownness. But on her entry into Washington
society she defied criticism by appearing
with her hair créped to show its soft brown
lights and shades, and give the best outline
to her head, her gypsy face opposed to a dead
white silk, of Parisian origin, with flounce of
pleated muslin, and corsage trimmings of rich
lace. It is a real dress and a real woman
that is described, and it is no fiction that she
was the success of the evening. The colorless
dress without <i>reflets</i>, and her ornaments
of clustered pearls, were in most artistic contrast
to the nut-brown hair and dusky face.
A spot of color would have destroyed the
charm. The dress stamped her, as she was, a
woman of skill sufficient to draw from the
most unlikely combination the elements of
novel and complete success.</p>

<p>The girl who sits near me at the hotel table
tries my eyes with her thin, curious features,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>her pale, frizzed hair, that makes her face
more peaked than it is, and her oversized
skirts. She ought not to wear those light
dresses, for she has no color, and her thin
complexion is not even clear. She has that
difficult figure to dispose of, which is at once
girlish and tall, without seeming so. A trained
dress would make her look lean, so she should
dispense with a large tournure, and let her
dresses brush the floor a few inches, wearing
as many small flounces below the knee as
fashion and sense allow. If her mother, who
is rather a strict lady, would insist on having
the girl’s dresses made with puffed waists, or
loose blouses of thick linen, instead of the
Victoria lawns that iron so flat, and show
the poor shoulder-blades frightfully, the effect
would be rather delightful. She ought to
wear puffed grenadines and lenos of maroon,
rosy lilac, or deep green—the first lighted with
pale rosy bows at the throat and in the hair,
the latter with light green and white, the lilac
with periwinkle knots. How one would like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>to dress her over again, and turn the poor
thing out charming as she ought to be. Her
hair-dressing would all have to be done over
again. Sharp-featured people shouldn’t wear
curls, which make the peaked effect still more
prominent. Soft waves, drawn lightly away
from the face and brushed up from the neck
behind, would be better, and smooth braids
best of all, with little waves peeping out under
them. If the young woman could train herself
not to be excitable, or to smile so overcomingly,
and not be so eager to meet new acquaintances,
she would make a pleasing impression,
while now she gets snubbed in a tacit
way, and those who take her up out of pity
hardly feel as if they were paid for it. If
women with hay-colored hair could be brought
to believe that light brown, of all others, wasn’t
the color for their style, one could afford to
overlook minor deficiencies.</p>

<p>One is tempted to think sometimes that
there is a loss in not adopting the French plan
of lining houses with mirrors. If people continually
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>caught sight of themselves, they would
hardly indulge in the grimaces and gaucheries
which they inflict on the world. It could hardly
lead to vanity in most cases, and would settle
many vexing problems of dress and demeanor.
One is not always to be censured for studying
the glass. The orator must use it to learn
how to deliver his sentences with proper
facial play and easy gesture. The public
singer studies with a mirror on the music-rack
to get the right position of the mouth
for issuing the voice without making a face.
The want of such training mars the work of
some great artists with blemishes which nearly
undo the effect of their talents.</p>

<p>The injunction that all things should be
done decently and in order means that they
ought to be pleasing. The study of ourselves
can hardly be complete without the aid of the
mirror, which shows candidly the cold smile,
the vacant, bashful gaze, we give our fellow-beings,
instead of the decent attention, the
kind, full glance it is meet they should have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>from us, and which we prefer to receive from
them. It shows the frown, the sour melancholy,
which creep over the face in reveries,
and leads us to try and feel pleasant that we
may look so. How much confidence one assuring
glance at a mirror has given us in going
to receive a visitor, and what kindly warning
of what was amiss in expression or toilet before
it was too late! Is our vanity so easily
excited that we are ready to fall in love with
ourselves at sight? The intimate acquaintance
with our appearance which the glass can give
is more likely to make one genuinely humble.
In a world which owns among its maxims the
gay and wicked refrain of “manners for us,
morals for those who like them,” good people
can not afford to neglect either their toilets
or their mirrors.</p>

<p>American girls begin to make much of
physical culture. As they advance in refinement
they see how much of their value in society
depends on the nerve and spirit which
accompanies thorough development. It is not
enough that they know how to dance languidly,
and carry themselves in company. To distinguish
herself, a young belle must row, swim,
skate, ride, and even shoot, to say nothing of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>lessons in fencing, which noble ladies in Germany,
and some of foreign family here, take
to develop sureness of hand and agility. The
heavy, flat-footed creature who can not walk
across a room without betraying the bad terms
her joints are on with each other, must have
a splendid face and fortune to keep any place
in the world, no matter how good her family,
or how varied her acquirements, though she
speaks seven languages like a native, and has
played sonatas since she was eight years old.
A woman’s value depends entirely on her use
to the world and to that person who happens
to have the most of her society. A man likes
the society of a woman who can walk a mile
or two to see an interesting view, and can
take long journeys without being laid up by
them. He likes smooth motions, round arms
and throat, head held straight, and shoulders
that do not bow out. When you see that a
fine figure must be a straight line from the
roots of the hair to the base of the shoulder-blade,
you will realize how few women approach
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>this high-bred ideal. Special culture,
indeed, is discerned where such excellence of
line meets the eye. The polished races of the
East, who, untutored and degraded, yet have
the entail of antique subtlety and art, inherit
such figures along with the proverbs of sages
and palace mosaics. The best-born of all
countries have this noble set of head, this
lance-like figure, and easy play of limb.
As surely as one can be educated to right
thoughts and manners, so the motions and
poise of limb can be trained to correctness.
The work must begin early. A girl should
be put in training as soon as she passes from
the plumpness of childhood into the ugly
age of development. The mother should inspect
her dressing to see what improvement is
needed, and stimulate the child by the desire
to possess beautiful limbs and figure. The
senses are early awake to the sense of grace.
There is no better way to inspire a girl with it
than to take her to picture-galleries, show the
faces of historical beauties, or the figures of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>Italian sculpture, and ask her if she would
not like to have the same fine points herself.
This substitutes the love of art for that of admiration,
and makes self-cultivation too deep
a thing for vanity.</p>

<p>There is a time when girls are awkward,
indolent, and capricious. Their boisterous
spirits at one time, their sickly minauderies at
another, are very trying to mothers and teachers.
The cause is often set down as depravity,
when it is only nature. Girls are lapsided
and indolent because they are weak or languid,
between which and being lazy there is
a vast difference. They have demanding appetites
that strike grown people with wonder.
They go frantic on short notice when their
wishes are crossed. Mother, if such is the
case, your growing girl is weak. The nursery
bath Saturday night is not enough. Encourage
her to take a sponge-bath every day.
When she comes in heated from a long walk
or play, see that she bathes her knees, elbows,
and feet in cold water, to prevent her growing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>nervous with fatigue when the excitement is
over. See that she does not suffer from cold,
and that she is not too warmly dressed, remembering
a plump, active child will suffer
with heat under the clothes it takes to keep
you comfortable. If she is thin and sensitive,
care must be taken against sudden chills.
Keep her on very simple but well-flavored
diet, with plenty of sour fruit, if she crave it,
for the young have a facility for growing bilious,
which acids correct. Sweet-pickles not
too highly spiced are favorites with children,
and better than sweetmeats. Nuts and raisins
are more wholesome than candies. New
cheese and cream are to be preferred to butter
with bread and vegetables. Soup and a little
of the best and juiciest meat should be given
at dinner. But the miscellaneous stuffing that
half-grown girls are allowed to indulge in
ruins their complexion, temper, and digestion.
No coffee nor tea should be taken by any human
being till it is full-grown. The excitement
of young nerves by these drinks is ruinous.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>Besides, the luxury and the stimulus is
greater to the adult when debarred from these
things through childhood. Neither mind nor
body should be worked till maturity. Children
will do all they ought in study and
work without much urging; and they will
learn more and remember more in two hours
of study to five of play, than if the order is
inverted. Say to a child, Get this lesson and
you may go to play—and you will be astonished
to see how rapidly it learns; but if one lesson
is to succeed another till six dreary hours
have dragged away, it loses heart, and learns
merely what can not well be helped. A girl
under eighteen ought not to practice at the
piano or sit at a desk more than three quarters
of an hour at a time. Then she should
run out-of-doors ten minutes, or exercise, to
relieve the nerves. An adult never ought to
study or sit more than an hour without brief
change before passing to the next. This
keeps the head clearer, the limbs fresher, and
carries one through a day with less fatigue
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>than if one worked eight hours and then rested
four.</p>

<p>Thoughtful teachers do not share the prejudice
against braces and backboards for keeping
the figure straight, especially when young.
It is the instinct of barbarous nations to use
such aids in compelling erectness in their children.
These appliances need not be painful
in the least, but rather relieve tender muscles
and bones. Languid girls should take cool
sitz-baths to strengthen the muscles of the
back and hips, which are more than ordinarily
susceptible of fatigue when childhood is
over. But <i>never</i> talk of a girl’s feelings in
mind or body before her, or suffer her to
dwell on them. The effect is bad physically
and mentally. See that these injunctions are
obeyed implicitly; spare her the whys and
wherefores. It is enough for her to know
that she will feel better for them. Of all
things, deliver us from valetudinarians of fifteen.
Never laugh at them; never sneer;
never indulge them in self-condolings. Be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>pitiful and sympathetic, but steadily turn their
attention to something interesting outside of
themselves.</p>

<p>Special means are essential to special growth.
Throwing quoits and sweeping are good exercises
to develop the arms. There is nothing
like three hours of house-work a day for giving
a woman a good figure, and if she sleep
in tight cosmetic gloves, she need not fear that
her hands will be spoiled. The time to form
the hands is in youth, and with thimbles for
the finger-tips, and close gloves lined with
cold cream, every mother might secure a good
hand for her daughter. She should be particular
to see that long-wristed lisle-thread gloves
are drawn on every time the girl goes out.
Veils she should discard, except in cold and
windy weather, when they should be drawn
close over the head. A broad-leafed hat for
the country is protection enough for the summer;
the rest of the year the complexion
needs all the sun it can get.</p>

<p>There is commonly a want of fullness in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>those muscles of the shoulder which give its
graceful slope. This is developed by the
use of the skipping-rope, in swinging it over
the head, and by battledoor, which keeps the
arms extended, at the same time using the
muscles of the neck and shoulders. Swinging
by the hands from a rope is capital, and so is
swinging from a bar. These muscles are the
last to receive exercise in common modes of
life, and playing ball, bean-bags, or pillow-fights
are convenient ways of calling them
into action. Singing scales with corsets off,
shoulders thrown back, lungs deeply inflated,
mouth wide open, and breath held, is the best
tuition for insuring that fullness to the upper
part of the chest which gives majesty to a
figure even when the bust is meagre. These
scales should be practiced half an hour morning
and afternoon, gaining two ends at once—increase
of voice and perfection of figure.</p>

<p>This brings us to the inquiries made by
more than one correspondent for some means
of developing the bust. Every mother should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>pay attention to this matter before her daughters
think of such a thing for themselves, by
seeing that their dresses are never in the least
constricted across the chest, and that a foolish
dressmaker never puts padding into their
waists. The horrible custom of wearing pads
is the ruin of natural figures, by heating and
pressing down the bosom. This most delicate
and sensitive part of a woman’s form must always
be kept cool, and well supported by a
linen corset. The open-worked ones are by
far the best, and the compression, if any, should
not be over the heart and fixed ribs, as it generally
is, but just at the waist, for not more
than the width of a broad waistband. Six
inches of thick coutille over the heart and
stomach—those parts of the body that have
most vital heat—must surely disorder them and
affect the bust as well. It would be better if
the coutille were over the shoulders or the abdomen,
and the whalebones of the corset held
together by broad tapes, so that there would
be less dressing over the heart, instead of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>more. A low, deep bosom, rather than a bold
one, is a sign of grace in a full-grown woman,
and a full bust is hardly admirable in an unmarried
girl. Her figure should be all curves,
but slender, promising a fuller beauty when
maturity is reached. One is not fond of over-ripe
pears.</p>

<p>Flat figures are best dissembled by puffed
and shirred blouse-waists, or by corsets with a
fine rattan run in the top of the bosom gore,
which throws out the fullness sufficiently to
look well in a plain corsage. Of all things,
India-rubber pads act most injuriously by
constantly sweating the skin, and ruining the
bust beyond hope of restoration. To improve
its outlines, wear a linen corset fitting so close
at the end of the top gores as to support the
bosom well. For this the corset must be fitted
to the skin, and worn next the under-flannel.
Night and morning wash the bust in the coldest
water—sponging it upward, but never
down. Madame Celnart relates that the bayaderes
of India cultivate their forms by wearing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>a cincture of linen under the breasts, and
at night chafing them lightly with a piece of
linen. The breasts should never be touched
but with the utmost delicacy, as other treatment
renders them weak and flaccid, and not
unfrequently results in cancer. A baby’s bite
has more than once inflicted this disease upon
its mother. But one thing is to be solemnly
cautioned, that no human being—doctor, nurse,
nor the mother herself—on any pretense, save
in case of accident, be allowed to touch a girl’s
figure. It would be unnecessary to say this,
were not French and Irish nurses, especially
old and experienced, ones, sometimes in the
habit of stroking the figures of young girls
committed to their charge, with the idea of
developing them. This is not mentioned from
hearsay. Mothers can not be too careful how
they leave their children with even well-meaning
servants. A young girl’s body is more
sensitive than any harp is to the air that plays
upon it. Nature—free, uneducated, and direct—responds
to every touch on that seat of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>nerves, the bosom, by an excitement that is
simply ruinous to a child’s nervous system.
This is pretty plain talking, but no plainer
than the subject demands. Girls are very different
in their feelings. Some affectionate,
innocent, hearty natures remain through their
lives as simple as when they were babes taking
their bath under their mothers’ hands; while
others, equally innocent but more susceptible,
require to be guarded and sheltered even from
the violence of a caress as if from contagion
and pain.</p>

<p>Due attention to the general health always
has its effect in restoring the bust to its roundness.
It is a mistake that it is irremediably
injured by nursing children. A babe may be
taught not to pinch and bite its mother, and
the exercise of a natural function can injure
her in no way, if proper care is taken to sustain
the system at the same time. Cold compresses
of wet linen worn over the breast are
very soothing and beneficial, provided they do
not strike a chill to a weak chest. At the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>same time, the cincture should be carefully
adjusted. Weakness of any kind affects the
contour of the figure, and it is useless to try to
improve it in any other way than by restoring
the strength where it is wanting. Tepid sitz-baths
strengthen the muscles of the hips, and
do away with that dragging which injures the
firmness of the bosom. Bathing in water to
which ammonia is added strengthens the skin,
but the use of camphor to dry the milk after
weaning a child is reprehensible. No drying
or heating lotions of any kind should ever be
applied except in illness.</p>

<p>People are in trouble in cold weather about
their hands and their complexions, which take
the time when parties abound, and owners
need their very best looks, to put on a ruinous
air. It is more than suspected that the young
lady who begs for some good face powder or
wash that will hide a bad complexion without
spoiling it entirely, has the end in view of
making herself presentable in society for the
winter. Her entirely reasonable request shall
be attended to, no less on her own account
than because she writes in the name of four
devoted subscribers. Carbolic soaps fail to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>remove the roughness of her used complexion,
and internal remedies must be resorted to.
These should be prescribed by a physician, and
would be passed over at once to his province
had not long experience shown that doctors
scoff at the idea of prescribing for such puny
troubles as flesh-worms and pimples while
there are so many typhoid fevers and chronic
ulcers to be treated. The pimples foretold
the fever, and the impurities that first showed
themselves in the shape of “black-heads”
might have been discharged at the time, and
not left to malignant issues. Pimples are disease
of a light form, and nature tries to throw
off in this way bad blood that might give one
a worse turn if kept in the body. It can not
be said too often that next to keeping murder
and wickedness out of one’s soul is the necessity
of keeping one’s blood pure by good food,
strict cleanliness, warmth, and bright, sweet
air. These troublesome pimples are a sign
that the young ladies who complain of them
have eaten food that did not suit them, eaten
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>irregularly, or not bathed often enough, since
some skins require more frequent cleansing
and stimulus than others, because they secrete
more. Perhaps other functions are disturbed,
or the blood is not stirred enough by lively
exercise. Directions for diet have been given
before in these pages. It will be enough to
recommend people with irritable blood to
drink a glass or two of mild cider, or eat oranges
or lemons, as they fancy, within the half
hour before each meal, especially before breakfast.
As hard work or exercise as one can endure
stirs sluggish secretions, and work should
always be brisk. Many a young woman mopes
over house-work day after day, standing on
her feet most of the time, and fancies that
she has exercise, when her slow blood does
not once in ten hours receive impulse enough
to send it vigorously from head to foot in a
way one could call living. “Work swiftly
and rest well,” ought to be a woman’s rule.
When the blood flows swiftly, the eye is clear,
the sight better, the skin refined, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>whole body feels improvement; memory and
thought are improved, idleness takes wing,
and happiness steals into the heart.</p>

<p>Young ladies should not give up their
bathing with carbolic soap. Hot water, with
a spoonful of prophylactic fluid or phenyl to
each quart, is a very wholesome bath in skin
disorders, followed by a brisk rub with crash
till warm, or wrapping in a blanket by the
fire till all danger of chilliness is past. The
phenyl and prophylactic fluid are milder
forms of carbolic acid, and, like it, disinfectant
and healing. A sponge-bath or plunge at
seventy-five degrees after a hot bath prevents
all weakening effects and taking cold. None
but robust persons should ever take baths except
in a warm room. The bath-room should
always be so arranged as to be heated in a
few minutes. Otherwise the bath is best
taken in one’s own room before the fire.</p>

<p>The disguise for a bad skin is easily found.
Refined chalk is the safest thing to use, and
costs far less by its own name than put up in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>photograph boxes as “Lily White,” etc. Cascarilla
powder, which the Cuban ladies use so
much, is recommended as entirely harmless.
It is prepared from a root used in medicine,
and in New York is sold at all the little Cuban
shops, with cigars, tropic sweetmeats, and other
necessaries of life. Either wash the face with
thick suds from glycerine soap, and dust the
powder on with a swan’s-down puff, removing
superfluous traces with a fresh puff kept
for the purpose, or else grind the powder in
wet linen by pressing it in the fingers, and
apply what oozes through to the skin. A fine
wash for a rough or sunburned skin is made
of two ounces of distilled water, one ounce of
glycerine, one ounce of alcohol, and half an
ounce of tincture of benzoin. Without the
water, and with the addition of two ounces of
prepared chalk free from bismuth, it makes a
far better cosmetic for whitening the face than
any of the expensive “Balms of Youth” or
“Magnolia Blooms.” If a flesh tint is desired,
add a grain of carmine.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>
<p>The lesser trial of rough, red hands that
are not chapped but unsightly, when not
caused by exposure and work, indicates bad
circulation of the blood. School-girls who
study a good deal without due exercise often
go home with flushed faces and red hands, to
say nothing of an irritable state of the nerves,
that can only be righted by very regular sleep
and exercise, aided by hot foot-baths. Out-door
exercise in winter is an excellent corrective
for rush of blood to the head. Dancing
brings the blood into play more healthfully
than any movement allowed to grown women.
The hands are improved by wearing gloves
that fit closely, especially if they are of soft
castor or dog-skin. In most cases, all that
is needed to soften hands is to rub sweet-almond oil
into the skin two or three days in
succession. A quicker way than this in the
country is to hold the hand on a rapidly turning
grindstone a moment or two. It leaves
the palm, forefinger, and thumb satin smooth,
and removes callosities incredibly quick, taking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>off bad stains at the same time. Farmers’
girls will take note of this, and also that
rubbing the hands with a slice of raw potato
will remove vegetable stains. Rubbing the
hands well with almond-oil, and plastering
them with as much fine chalk as they can
take, on going to bed, will usually whiten them
in three days’ time, and this hint may be of
service before a party of consequence.</p>

<p>Redness of the nose is a sign of bad circulation
and of humor in the blood. It is best
treated by applications of phenyl, rubbed on
often each day, and by alteratives. A spoonful
of white mustard-seed taken in water before
breakfast every morning is of service in
this case and in rush of blood to the head,
which always has something to do with constipation.
Refined chalk made into a thick
plaster with one third as much glycerine as
water, and spread on the parts, will cool erysipelatous
inflammation and reduce the redness.</p>

<p>The secrets of “making-up” have hardly all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>been mentioned, though the list is growing
long. What girl does not know that eating
lump-sugar wet with Cologne just before going
out will make her eyes bright, or that the
homelier mode of flirting soap-suds into them
has the same effect? Spanish ladies squeeze
orange juice into their eyes to make them
shine. A Continental recipe for whitening the
hands looks strong enough: Take half a pound
of soft-soap, a gill of salad-oil, an ounce of
mutton tallow, and boil together; after boiling
ceases, add one gill of spirits of wine and
a scruple of ambergris; rip a pair of gloves
three sizes too large, spread them with this
paste, and sew up to be worn at night. A
curious wash, evidently Italian in its origin, is:
Equal parts of melon, pumpkin, gourd, and
cucumber seeds pounded to powder, softened
with cream, and thinned to a paste with milk,
perfumed with a grain of musk and three drops
of oil of lemon (oil of jasmine may be substituted
for the musk). The face, bosom, and arms
are anointed with this overnight, and washed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>off in warm water in the morning. The authority
quoted says it adds remarkable purity
and brilliance to the complexion. Such pains
will women take for that beauty which, after
all, is only skin deep. But did not De Staël
say she would give half her knowledge for
personal charms.</p>

<p>Women’s looks depend too much on the
state of their nerves and their peace of mind
to pass them over. The body at best is the
perfect expression of the soul. The latter
may light wasted features to brilliance, or
turn a face of milk and roses dark with passion
or dead with dullness; it may destroy a
healthy frame or support a failing one. Weak
nerves may prove too much for the temper of
St. John, and break down the courage of Saladin.
Better things are before us, coming
from a fuller appreciation of the needs of
body and soul, but the fact remains that this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>is a generation of weak nerves. It shows
particularly in the low tone of spirits common
to men and women. They can not bear sunshine
in their houses; they find the colors of
Jacques Minot roses and of Gérome’s pictures
too deep; the waltz in <i>Traviata</i> is too brilliant,
Rossini’s music is too sensuous, and Wagner’s
too sensational; Mendelssohn is too light,
Beethoven too cold. Their work is fuss; instead
of resting, they idle—and there is a
wide difference between the two things. People
who drink strong tea and smoke too many
cigars, read or stay in-doors too much, find
the hum of creation too loud for them. The
swell of the wind in the pines makes them
gloomy, the sweep of the storm prostrates
them with terror, the everlasting beating of
the surf and the noises of the streets alike
weary their worthless nerves. The happy
cries of school-children at play are a grievance
to them; indeed, there are people who
find the chirp of the hearth cricket and the
singing tea-kettle intolerable. But it is a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>sign of diseased nerves. Nature is full of
noises, and only where death reigns is there
silence. One wishes that the men and women
who can’t bear a child’s voice, a singer’s practice,
or the passing of feet up and down stairs
might be transported to silence like that which
wraps the poles or the spaces beyond the stars,
till they could learn to welcome sound, without
which no one lives.</p>

<p>Children must make noise, and a great deal
of it, to be healthy. The shouts, the racket,
the tumble and turmoil they make, are nature’s
way of ventilating their bodies, of sending
the breath full into the very last corner of
the lungs, and the blood and nervous fluid into
every cord and fibre of their muscles. Instead
of quelling their riot, it would be a blessing to
older folks to join it with them. There is an
awful truth following this assertion. Do you
know that men and women go mad after the
natural stimulus which free air and bounding
exercise supply? It is the lack of this most
powerful inspiration, which knows no reaction,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>that makes them drunkards, gamesters,
and flings them into every dissipation of body
and soul. Men and women, especially those
leading studious, repressed lives, often confess
to a longing for some fierce, brief madness
that would unseat the incubus of their lives.
Clergymen, editors, writing women, and those
who lead sedentary lives, have said in your
hearing and mine that something ailed them
they could not understand. They felt as if
they would like to go on a spree, dance the
tarantella, or scream till they were tired. They
thought it the moving of some depraved impulse
not yet rooted out of their natures, and
to subdue it cost them hours of struggle and
mortification. Poor souls! They need not
have visited themselves severely if they had
known the truth that this lawless longing was
the cry of idle nerve and muscle, frantic
through disuse. What the clergyman wanted
was to leave his books and his subdued demeanor
for the hill-country, for the woods,
where he could not only walk, but leap, run,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>shout, and wrestle, and sing at the full strength
of his voice. The editor needed to leave his
cigar and the midnight gas-light for a wherry
race, or a jolly roll and tumble on the green.
The woman, most of all, wanted a tent built
for her on the shore, or on the dry heights of
the pine forest, where she would have to take
sun by day and balsamic air by night; where
she would have to leap brooks, gather her own
fire-wood, climb rocks, and laugh at her own
mishaps. Or, if she were city-pent, she needed
to take some child to the Park and play
ball with it, and run as I saw an elegant girl
dressed in velvet and furs run through Madison
Square one winter day with her little sister.
The nervous, capricious woman must be
sent to swimming-school, or learn to throw
quoits or jump the rope, to wrestle or to sing.
There is nothing better for body and mind
than learning to sing, with proper method,
under a teacher who knows how to direct the
force of the voice, to watch the strength, and
expand the emotions at the same time. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>health of many women begins to improve
from the time they study music. Why? Because
it furnishes an outlet for their feelings,
and equally because singing exerts the lungs
and muscles of the chest which lie inactive.
The power for the highest as well as the
lowest note is supplied by the bellows of
the lungs, worked by the mighty muscles of
the chest and sides. In this play the red
blood goes to every tiny cell that has been
white and faint for want of its food; the
engorged brain and nervous centres where the
blood has settled, heating and irritating them,
are relieved; the head feels bright, the hands
grow warm, the eyes clear, and the spirits
lively. This is after singing strongly for half
an hour. The same effect is gained by any
other kind of brisk work that sets the lungs
and muscles going, but as music brings emotion
into play, and is a pleasure or a relief as
it is melancholy or gay, it is preferable. The
work that engages one’s interest as well as
strength is always the best. Per contra, whatever
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>one does thoroughly and with dispatch
seldom continues distasteful. There is more
than we see at a glance in the command,
“Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it
with thy might.” The reason given, because
the time is short for all the culture and all the
good work we wish to accomplish, is the apparent
one; but the root of it lies in the necessities
of our being. Only work done with our
might will satisfy our energies and keep their
balance. Half the women in the world are
suffering from chronic unrest, morbid ambitions,
and disappointments that would flee like
morning mist before an hour of hearty, tiring
work.</p>

<p>It is not so much matter what the work
is, as how it is done.</p>

<p>The weak should take work up by degrees,
working half an hour and resting, then going
at it steadily again. It is better to work a little
briskly and rest than to keep on the slow
drag through the day. Learn not only to do
things well, but to do them quickly. It is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>disgraceful to loiter and drone over one’s
work. It is intolerable both in music and in
life.</p>

<p>The body, like all slaves, has the power to
react on its task-master. All mean passions
appear born of diseased nerves. Was there
ever a jealous woman who did not have dyspepsia,
or a high-tempered one without a tendency
to spinal irritation? Heathen tempers
in young people are a sign of wrong health,
and mothers should send for physician as well
as priest to exorcise them. The great remedy
for temper is—sleep. No child that sleeps
enough will be fretful; and the same thing is
nearly as true of children of larger growth.
Not less than eight hours is the measure of
sleep for a healthy woman under fifty. She
may be able to get on with less, and do considerable
work, either with mind or hands.
But she could do so much more, to better satisfaction,
by taking one or two hours more
sleep, that she can not afford to lose it. Women
who use their brains—teachers, artists, writers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>and housewives (whose minds are as hard
wrought in overseeing a family as those of
any one who works with pen or pencil)—need
all the sleep they can get. From ten to six,
or, for those who do not want to lose theatres
and lectures altogether, from eleven to seven,
are hours not to be infringed upon by women
who want clear heads and steady tempers.
What they gain by working at night they are
sure to lose next day, or the day after. It is
impossible to put the case too strongly. Unless
one has taken a narcotic, and sleeps too
long, one should <i>never</i> be awakened. The body
rouses itself when its demands are satisfied.
A warm bath on going to bed is the best aid
to sleep. People often feel drowsy in the
evening about eight or nine o’clock, but are
wide awake at eleven. They should heed the
warning. The system needs more rest than it
gets, and is only able to keep up by drawing
on its reserve forces. Wakefulness beyond
the proper time is a sign of ill health as much
as want of appetite at meals—it is a pity that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>people are not as much alarmed by it. The
brain is a more delicate organ than the stomach,
and nothing so surely disorders it as want
of sleep. In trouble or sorrow, light sedatives
should be employed, like red lavender or the
bromate of potassa, for the nerves have more
to bear, and need all the rest they can get.
The warm bath, I repeat, is better than either.</p>

<p>Sunshine, music, work, and sleep are the
great medicines for women. They need more
sleep than men, for they are not so strong, and
their nerves perhaps are more acute. Work
is the best cure for ennui and for grief. Let
them sing, whether of love, longing, or sorrow,
pouring out their hearts, till the love returns
into their own bosoms, till the longing has
spent its force, or till the sorrow has lifted
itself into the sunshine, and taken the hue of
trust, not of despair.</p>

<p>The secret of content for most women is
not perfection, but change. They can not
even be satisfied with their looks long at a
time; but Mary, Queen of Hearts as well as
Scots, must draw an auburn wig over her luxurious
tresses, dark and smelling of violets, for
which regal-haired Elizabeth would have given
the ruffs out of her best gowns, and her recipe
for yellow starch with them. The “pretty
Miss Vavasour,” who changed her chignon every
morning with her costume, was a type of
the fickle beauties of the day, who are always
better satisfied with some other woman’s style
than their own. Women of intelligence send
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>urgent requests for something to change the
color of their hair, either to make the front
locks match the châtelaine braid, or to bleach
it outright. Fair blondes, whose sunny locks
have been their pride, find with dismay that
this infantile tinge, which makes a woman look
so young and charming, is deepening into mature
ash-brown—a shade with no prestige or
attraction whatever. In their exact eyes it is
mortifying to wear a blonde braid several degrees
lighter than the crown tresses. These
last are growing, and constantly change, while
the ends keep their early tinge. Very few
light-haired people pass from youth to middle
age without such a change. But, unless the
difference is very startling, it may be made
agreeable by skillfully dressing the hair.
Light or varied hair should be crimped or
waved, when its tints will appear like the play
of light and shade. Contrary to all writers on
this point, I contend that crimping does not
necessarily injure the hair. If it is killed—pulled
out by the roots, or broken by frizzing—the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>blame is due to careless or ignorant
dressing. My own hair was dressed regularly
twice or thrice a week with hot irons for
years, and it never grew so fast or was in such
a satisfactory state. It was thoroughly combed
and brushed, kept clean by weekly washing,
and each time it went under the curling-tongs
it came out moist and stimulated by the heat.
The reason was, the clever French coiffeur
knew his business, and never allowed the hot
iron to come directly in contact with the hair.
Each lock was done up in papillotes, and then
pinched with irons as hot as could be without
scorching. Stiff hair may be trained to curl
by long and patient treatment with hot irons,
and be all the better for it. The secret of safe
hair-dressing is never to pull the hair, never
scorch, and always wrap a lock in paper before
applying the iron. Common round curling-irons
and frizzing-tongs may be safety
used if thin Manilla paper is folded once
around them. So in crimping: the hair may
be done up on stout crimping-pins held by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>slides, or braided in and out of a loop of thick
cord, a bit of thin paper folded over the crimp,
and the pinching-iron used with safety every
day, provided the hair is not pulled too tight
in braiding it. The country method, where
friseur’s irons are unknown, is to lay the head
on a table, and set a hot smoothing-iron on
the woven lock—an awkward but efficient
process. It is not good to put the hair up on
metal pins or hair-pins overnight for two reasons:
the perspiration of the head will rust
the pins, insensibly, so that they will cut the
hair; and the contact of iron with the sulphurous
gas given out by hair during sleep
tends to darken and render the color displeasing.
Rubber crimping-pins, fastened by a
rubber catch, are a late invention, and a great
improvement. But a loop of thick elastic
cord is better than any thing. The hair is
woven in and out as on a hair-pin, the elastic
holds it when the fingers are withdrawn, and
it is pleasanter to sleep in than half a dozen
stiff pins. I know more than one piquant little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>lady whose “naturally” waving tresses are
the admiration of her friends by this simple
means; and as the process has gone on for
years without lessening the flow of ruffled
hair, it must be conceded that crimping does
not always hurt it. Iron hair-pins hurt the
head more than a generation of friseurs. The
latest accusation against them is that they
draw off the healthy electricity of the head;
and to a generation which complains of paralysis
from using steel pens, and uses patent
glass insulators for the legs of its bedsteads,
this will seem no frivolous charge. The patent
insulators are a fact. Their use is advised
by medical men for all neuralgic, rheumatic,
and sleepless people, and one of the largest
glass firms in New York makes their manufacture
a specialty. The patent and perfect
hair-pin is not yet invented. Rubber pins are
clumsy if harmless, but there are gilt hair-pins
made of a yellow composition metal which are
pleasanter to use than common ones, and very
becoming in blonde hair. Dark-haired people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>must stick to the rubber pins, or at least see
that their black ones are well japanned, so as
not to cut their locks.</p>

<p>Now, to give an opinion about the change
of hair, we must know something of its nature,
and what colors it. Wise men say that
light hair is owing to an abundance of sulphur
in the system, and dark hair to an excess of
iron. So if we comb light or red locks with
lead combs for a long time, the lead acts on
the sulphureted hydrogen evolved by the hair,
and darkens it. If we can neutralize the iron
in any way, a contrary effect will be obtained.
To do this, work at the dark hair precisely as
if it were an ink-spot to be taken out. The
skin should not suffer, and to prevent this, oil
it carefully along the parting, edges, and crown
of the head, wiping the oil from the hair with
a soft cloth. Oxalic acid, strong and hot, is
the best thing to take out spots of ink made
with iron, and we may try this with the hair.
To apply this, or any of the preparations
named, one should be in undress, wearing not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>a single article whose destruction would be of
account, for all the acids and bleaching powders
used ruin clothes if a drop touch them,
taking the color out, and eating holes in the
stoutest fabrics. The eyelids and brows should
be well oiled to prevent the acid from attacking
them, and the hands, shoulders, and face
will be the better for similar protection. On
one ounce of pure, strong oxalic acid pour one
pint of boiling water, and, as soon as the hands
can bear it, wet the head with a sponge, not
sapping it, but moistening thoroughly. The
effect may be hastened by holding the head in
strong sunlight, or over a register, or the steam
of boiling water. Five minutes ought to show
a decided change, but if it do not, wet again
and again, allowing the acid to remain as long
as it does not eat the skin. This may not be
hard to bear, but it will make the hair fall out.</p>

<p>Another mode is to cover the hair with a
paste of powdered sulphur and water, and sit
in the sun with it for several hours. The Venetian
ladies used to steep their tresses in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>caustic solutions, and sit in their balconies in
the sun all day, bleaching it; and yet another
day, that the same rays might turn it yellow.
Perhaps they gained by their folly in one way
what they lost in another, for such an airing
and sunning would benefit the health of any
woman. A paste of bisulphate of magnesia
and lime is very effectual for bleaching the
hair; but it must be used with great caution
not to burn hair, skin, and brains together.
The moment it begins seriously to attack the
skin it should be washed off in three waters,
with lemon juice or vinegar in the last one to
neutralize the alkali. These pastes are recommended
to turn ash-colored hair light. To
bleach dark hair is a long and tedious process,
and such an utter piece of foolery that I do
not care to recount the directions for it. The
desire to change the color of the hair can only
be justified when it is of a dull and sickly appearance,
and this is best mended by improving
the general health. Hair can not be
glossy, rich-colored, and thick unless the bodily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>vigor is what it should be. Indeed, hair is
one of the surest indexes to the state of health.
Scorched and foxy locks are a sign of neglect
and of bad secretions. Brushing remedies the
first condition, hygiene the next. But among
the varieties of treatment specially appropriate
to restoration of the hair, sulphur vapor-baths
must once more be mentioned. Doses
of sulphur, taken in Dotheboys’ fashion weekly,
with molasses, will be of service in keeping
the blood pure, and in time will affect the
hair; but this powerful agent should not be
used without advice of a physician, and the
dose should be always followed by simple purgatives,
like mustard-seed, figs, or prunes, eaten
freely. Chlorines and chlorides are specifics
for bleaching hair, but they turn it gray or
white, and the yellow tinge is dyed afterward.
Sulphurous applications are the safest, if common
caution is used not to take cold afterward
or to breathe any fumes from them.</p>

<p>Switches that have lost freshness may be
very much improved by dipping them into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>common ammonia without dilution. Half a
pint is enough for the purpose. The life and
color of the hair is revived as if it were just
cut from the head. This dipping should be repeated
once in three months, to free the switch
from dust, as well as to insure safety from
parasitic formations. The subject of coloring
the hair will be spoken of in another
chapter.</p>

<p>If it were easy to change the color of one’s
hair, and possible to fix that change, which it
is not, the result in most cases would be far
from desirable. Nature tints hair and complexion
in harmony with each other, and
both should be deepened if one is altered.
Human pictures as well as canvas would often
be improved by bringing out the colors,
but the free hand of Health, that divine artist,
is the only one whose work is tolerable or enduring.
In health this harmony of tint is varied
and delicate, ranging from the rose-and-snow
complexions that suit the true <i>blonde
dorée</i>, the translucent honeysuckle-pink that
sets off red-brown, blue-black, and olive-brown
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>hair with decided warmth of cheeks, or purple-black
reflets of the tresses with Spanish
crimson, or rather the burning rose of tropic
blood seen through smooth skin. Occasionally
there comes an exciting discord, a minor
strain of color that affects one like subtle
music, such as the finding of dark eyes and
golden hair, or clear, brilliant blue eyes in a
gypsy face; but it is impossible to compose
heads in reality with any satisfying results as
yet. We have yet to learn how to work from
the inside out, which is the only true method
with human modeling.</p>

<p>All that can be said on this point, however,
will not make the red-haired girl one whit less
ardent in her desire to see her locks of darker
shade, that they may be less conspicuous, or
keep the dark-haired woman from the coveted
vision of bright locks and black eyes. It is
useless to talk about the dangers of the process,
or hint that orpiment and realgar are
deadly poisons. If every hair had to turn
into a living snake while undergoing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>change, it would hardly daunt this courageous
vanity. The best to be hoped from any farther
enlightenment is that they will renounce
these active poisons for something comparatively
harmless. <i>Du reste</i>, all readers will be
interested in the secrets of the toilet, and the
sight of science turned coiffeur.</p>

<p>It is comparatively a simple matter to dye
hair black. Sulphur is one of the constituents
of hair, which exhales it constantly in the
form of sulphureted hydrogen, fortunately of
the weakest sort, or it would be intolerable.
When wet with a solution of certain metals,
the action of this gas turns the hair black.
Lead combs owe their efficiency to this cause.
The lead which rubs on the hair is darkened
by the gas, but the trace of lead at each
combing is so slight that the operation must
be many times repeated before it takes effect.
But lead-coloring, whether applied by combs
or by the paste of litharge, is a slow poison,
not seldom causing paralysis, and even death.
The absorption of lead into the system at any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>part is dangerous, but trebly so when applied
so closely to the brain. The tint given by
this means, as well as that dyed with nitrate
of silver, is unnatural, greenish, and rusty in
the light, needing continual repetition to appear
decent.</p>

<p>Orientals are in the habit of dyeing their
hair and beards the deep jetty black which
they admire, if nature have not given them
the desired depth of color. For this purpose
Turks and Egyptians use a thick solution of
native iron ore in pyrogallic acid, which gives
the blackest and most unimpeachable color.
The Persians prefer blue-black, and use indigo
to produce it. European hair-dyers use a solution
of iron, with hydrosulphate of ammonia
to develop and fix the color, but the odor is
objectionable. Dyes need to be applied once
a week to keep the color vivid, and it is well
to touch the partings twice as often with a
fine comb dipped in the dye, as the hair always
shows the natural color as fast as it
grows from the roots.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>
<p>Red and flaxen hair is changed to gold
with little trouble, but dark hair must be
bleached with chlorine before the desired tinge
is given. The bleaching is the most difficult
part of the work. Solutions sold for the purpose
oftenest consist of peroxide of hydrogen—a
somewhat costly liquid, I am told. Solution
of sulphurous acid will also bleach hair;
so will solutions of bisulphide of magnesia
and of lime. The hair, properly faded or
whitened, is colored yellow with solutions of
cadmium, arsenic, or gold, but the cause of
the change is the same that produces black
dye. The reaction of sulphureted hydrogen
on silver or lead turns things black, but on
the metals first named turns them yellow.
Arsenic in the shape of orpiment or realgar,
two deadly poisons, is the base of most
golden hair-dyes, and numerous cases of poisoning
have resulted from their use. Cadmium
is harmless, and yields quite as brilliant
a tinge as arsenic, though less used. Chloride
of gold dyes a very satisfactory brown, available
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>for eyebrows, lashes, and whiskers. It
must be used with exceeding care, however,
for it stains the skin as well as the hair. If
applied with a fine-tooth comb dipped in the
liquid, combing the ends first, and ceasing just
before the skin is reached, the dye will probably
“take” by means of capillary attraction,
without affecting the face. Cautious use of
this preparation on the brows and lashes gives
very pleasing results when these are much
paler than the hair. They should be first
carefully oiled, and the oil wiped off the hair,
which is then touched with a fine sable pencil.</p>

<p>Fortunately, bleaching and dyeing are both
such tedious processes that this circumstance
alone will keep many persons from submitting
to their bondage. Once applied, the dye becomes
a necessity, much harder to leave off
than to begin, as the English Dr. Scoffern
says, who is authority for most suggestions in
this chapter. One can not blame those persons
who brush the roots of the hair or forehead
and neck with amber lavender to disguise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>their pale, unsightly appearance, and a
touch of the same liquid on white eyebrows
does no harm. Walnut bark, steeped a week
in Cologne, gives a dye that is transient, but
easily applied with a brush each day, and has
instant effect. It takes a day or two to bleach
hair, and hours to color it either black or yellow;
and the work has to be done over month
by month in a fashion that brings the victim
to speedy repentance of her folly.</p>
